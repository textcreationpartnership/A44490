            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A Subject never ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb facs="tcp:53764:3"/>
looked upon, never throughly enough ſeen into, while we can ſee but with mortal eyes, and imperfect understandings: the great Myſtery of Godlineſs. God manifeſted in the Fleſh; justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Spirit; ſeen (yea, very intenſively pryed into, <hi>1 Pet. 1.12</hi>) of Angels, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us Gentiles, believed on in the World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up into Glory, <hi>1 Tim. 3.16.</hi> The great Catholicon, the Soveraign and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for all our ſpiritual diſtempers and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the ſupply of all our wants, the ſupport of us in all our weakneſſes, temptations, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the inſtructer and helper of us in, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all our ſervices, the ſtay of us in this life, in and under all its various viciſſitudes and changes, the joy and comfort of our hearts in Death, the Raiſer and Reſurrection both of our Souls to lively hope, and comfort when oppreſſed with griefs, and caſt down with ſadneſs; and alſo of our Bodies to immortality and Eternal happineſs, in a word the ſpring, original and fountain of all our felicity, the great ſubject of the Doctrine, both of the holy Prophets, and of the holy Apoſtles, the ſubſtance and body of all the types and ſhadows in the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> the accompliſhment and fulfilling of Predictions and Prophecies, and the ground and end of all
<pb facs="tcp:53764:3"/>
our future hopes and expectations. Such (<hi>I</hi> ſay not is this Treatiſe but) the ſubject treated of, and directed to herein; for, it is no other than Chriſt himſelf and Him crucified, and through ſufferings and death raiſed up again and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Glorified of God for thee in his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious actings, in and upon Him, and glorified of God to thee by the ſpirit of God in his word and teſtimony: glorified both ways to ſave and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee from the ſtings of the old Serpent, and to bring thee to glory. A Subject which who can ſufficiently treat of; for, who can ſhew forth all his marvailous acts? who can ſet forth all his praiſes? <hi>Pſal. 106.2.</hi> A Subject much too great for my imbecillity and stupidity, too deep, and high, and large, and long for my narrow head and heart to reach its dimenſions, ſo as to handle it, and ſet it forth worthily. A Subject in my reception of it into, and conception of this Diſcourſe about it in my mind, and earneſtneſs of my heart to draw it out, and incorporate it in this body, and give it theſe lines and lineaments, ſo pleaſing to me (or perhaps rather my exerciſe therein) that it drew me on with ſo eager an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and rapid a motion, as indangered my miſcarrying of it, before its perfection; for, I received in my ſelf, in a manner, the ſentence of
<pb facs="tcp:53764:4"/>
Death before I had finiſhed it, till God renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſtrength beyond my expectation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, it attained to this Period. God therein both ſhewing me my weakneſs (and perhaps alſo chaſtening my unworthineſs and unmeetneſs for ſuch an undertaking, and my darkning wiſdome ſo much by words without knowledge, and ſo ſlenderly and ſlovenly handling ſo excellent a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, both therein, and ſince in its ſticking ſo long, and coming out at length with ſo many Errata's in its impreſſion) and yet alſo ſhewing his great power and goodneſs in what I received of him for my reviving. I confeſs I had ſome eye in it, upon a good and gracious Woman, who had met with ſome exerciſe in the death of her only Son, and intended ſhe ſhould have had one of the firſt rights of it, as for comforting her alſo, I put in ſome expreſſions, reſpecting that her try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in ſome part of its application; but the Lord pleaſed to put an end to her days alſo, before it could arrive at her, and be peruſed by her. He deſigning to comfort and ſatisfy her ſpirit, I truſt with another, and far perfecter ſight of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this bleſſed Son of man, here treated of, then this ſo weak a diſcourſe could have given her of him. I truſt its conception was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without the Holy Ghoſt, though as it was
<pb facs="tcp:53764:4"/>
imbodyed in, and by me, I cannot but ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge its too great likeneſs to me in imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. It is a rule in Philoſophy, that <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> Whatſoever is received of another, is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after the manner or meaſure of the receiver. We cannot expect that a Bucket can contain the Ocean, and the pureſt Wine received in a fuſty Cask will ſomewhat taſt of it. The Eternal Word as conceived in the Virgins Womb, was made partaker of her Fleſh, and as therein brought forth by her, appeared a weak and little one; not according to the Immenſity and Infinity of the Word, but in ſuch ſmall and finite dimenſions, as agreed to the humane nature, and the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Womb, in which it was formed, and therefore He was capable of being wrapt in ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cloths, and laid in a Manger, and afterward of being taken up in old <hi>Simeon</hi>'s armes, and of growing in ſtature, in wiſdome, and in favour both with God and man, <hi>Luc. 2.7, 28, 52.</hi> Yea, and though through the operation of the Holy Ghoſt, He was conceived, and brought forth without any ſtain of ſin in his Fleſh, yet He was born with a fore-skin thereon, ſo as He was capable of receiving Circumciſion, as well in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, He paſſed through Baptiſme, and that
<pb facs="tcp:53764:5"/>
too, not only of Water, but alſo of fire or afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in manifold ſorrows, ſufferings, and Death, not otherwiſe agreeable to the Divine and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Word; which yet was ſo made and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in that Fleſh, as to render thoſe ſufferings, and that Death a full and all-ſufficient Sacrifice, and expiation for the ſins of the World. Yea, that Heavenly Word, in and through the Fleſh, ſo ſpake, and ſo wrought, as to procure, and to produce the good of men; not only in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and healing them, as there was need, and He judged them meet or worthy thereof, and they worthily complyed therewith: but alſo ſo as to the Eternal ſalvation of all that duly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd Him. And me thinks there is a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy and reſemblance between the conception and incarnation of that bleſſed Word, and its manifeſtation in the Fleſh; and the Conception of Divine truth in the mind of man, and its manifestation in word or writing, though there is and may be much diſagreement alſo therein. Verily the truth of God cannot be comprehended in its fulneſs, in and by the narrow, finite mind of mortal man, (as well the truth of God, as the peace of God doubtleſs paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) at leaſt while mortal, and till (if
<pb facs="tcp:53764:5"/>
that may be) though a perfect union with it, it's advanced to its Divine and Inconceiveable large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor can what is there conceived, and thence emitted or brought forth, but he bounded by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of the mind that receives and emits it, and pertake in its expreſſion of ſomewhat of its infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: Yea, oft-times it receives ſome mixtures of Sinfulneſs, Ignorance and Miſtakes, or other Diſtempers from it, in its being conceived, word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or writ, at leaſt ſuch coverings and ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as render a Circumciſion by the Spirit of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, or an underſtanding Spirit; or a Baptiſm, or Cleanſing from the defilements mixed with it, and a Remiſſion of the ſinfulneſs therein at the hands of God needful for it, in which it differs from the word Incarnate of the Virgin; for from her he received nothing of ſin, and therefore neither needed Circumciſion, nor Baptiſm for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, to admit him into Covenant and Acceptance with God: Though both Circumciſion and Baptiſm he received, that he might fulfil all Righteouſneſs. But the Divine Testimony recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the ſanctified Minds, and expreſſed in the Preachings and Writings of the Holy Men of God, the Apoſtles and Prophets bare, and beareth a far fuller Analogy thereto, then as in any other men; it contracted nothing of ſinfulneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs
<pb facs="tcp:53764:6"/>
to it ſelf as received and given forth by them, from their receit of it or giving it forth. And therefore in all the Prophecyings of other men, though not to be deſpiſed, we are <hi>to try all things and hold faſt that that is good.</hi> To try them not by comparing them with, or bringing them to the Sayings, Traditions, reputedly Orthodox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. Frames, Syſtimes, or Compoſure of other men, of what ever party, no, though of the strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Sect of Religion, among a profeſſed people of God; but even their Sayings, Traditions, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, Frames, Systimes, or Compoſures, are all and every of them to be tried and judged of by the words and ſayings of the holy Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and wherein ſoever any of theirs, or any mans Doctrine or Sayings diſagree there-with, they may, and ought to be rejected of us. But their Sayings are in all things to be Reverenced and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without doubt or ſuſpition, as the Sayings of God (as indeed they are) though uttered and given forth by men. And even as Christ though as Born of a Woman, and as to his Fleſh parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of mans Infirmity, yet had in him for all that, even in that ſtate, the Power and Force of the Eternal Word, ſo as that to them that received him he give heavenly Light, Life, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding, Strength and Freedom; yea, the <hi>Power</hi> and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg

               <hi>to be the Sons of God, even to them who believed on his Name:</hi> And though his Fleſh and Body might ſuffer Pain, and be Abuſed, and Crucified, as indeed it was: Yet his Deity, or the bleſſed Word was not thereby impaired, even ſo the Truth of God received and conceived in a pure Mind and good Conſcience (as in the holy Apostles and Prophets, it most certainly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was) and thence brought forth to Light, by Word or Writing (with which it's Clothed, and as it were Imbodied) though its form appearing according to the Model of the mind that conceives it, and the Letter or Speech in which it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, may ſeem rude and plain (as the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> Speech was by ſome ſaid to be contemptible <hi>2 Cor. 10.10.</hi>) yea, and may be expoſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe injuries or abuſes: Yet the Divine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly truth (though in that Dreſs) retains its Divine Nature and Worth. True it is that its force towards others, may by ſuch Injuries be leſs apparent, and they may therefore more ſlight and diſregard it; as Christ alſo by reaſon of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Reproaches and Abuſes, was more ſlighted by many: But yet where indeed minded and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, it produceth ſingular and Divine effects in their Hearts and Lives, by virtue of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature and Spirit, that is in and with it:
<pb facs="tcp:53764:7"/>
So as to Inlighten, Inſtruct, Reprove, Convert, Comfort, Cleanſe, Sanctifie and Save them; yea, make them the Sons of God, and in ſome meaſure like to God, and in the end Bleſſed and Happy; as on the other hand to thoſe that Reject or Abuſe it, it occaſions the greater Judgment, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier Condemnation; and ſo doth Christ alſo to them that ſtumble at, and reject Him and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Wherefore the Heavenly Truth is not to be Judged by, or Valued according to its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Dreſs and Clothing, nor according to the Man and his Meanneſs through whom it comes, and in and by whom it is as it were Imbodied: But it is to be received according to its Divine Original, and to be made much of according to its excellent Virtues and Effects; though no mans Saying or Writing is further the Truth of God and Divine, then it is of God, and is purely emitted from a pure Mind.</p>
            <p>Thou muſt apply this Analogy fully and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as is ſaid, to the Word and Preaching of the holy Apostles and Prophets, and to other Mens, only ſo far as one with and agreeable thereto; and ſo far thou mayſt apply it to this Diſcourſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented here to thee. Chriſt lifted up as the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent was by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Wilderneſs, is of only and unſpeakable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs and Virtue,
<pb facs="tcp:53764:7"/>
for the ſaving the Souls of thoſe that View and Believe on him from Sin and Deſtruction: And for fitting them by Regeneration for, and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them by his Divine Power and Virtue, to life Everlaſting in his heavenly Kingdom. But this excellent matter (worthy to have been conceived in a more pure Womb or Mind, and laid in a far better Dreſs then I have here wrapt it in) as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and Diſcourſed of by me, partakes of, and evidences my great weakeneſs; and as here Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, the <hi>Printers</hi> and <hi>Stationers</hi> too great Careleſsneſs or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs (both which may gain it diſreſpect to many) and is as here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented far ſhort of that Excellency and Glory that Properly and Originally is its own, and appertains to it; and may perhaps meet with courſe Reſpect, Cenſurings and Sufferings, if it fall into ſome mens hands; eſpecially from the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> men Learned and of great Zeal for Gods Ordinances and Worſhip to appearance; but yet ſuch as have their Faith and Fear towards God, taught them by the Traditions and Traditional Gloſſes of ſome Elders of their Party. According to which alſo they Teach it to others, and generally from Proud and Malevolent perſons. But yet if (the Superfluity and Fleſhlineſs of its Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in any thing, being cut off by the judicious
<pb facs="tcp:53764:8"/>
Judgment, and charitable candid Conſtructions of the understanding Reader, and it being Animated by the holy Spirit, and his Preſence and Bleſſing) it be duly conſidered, liſtened to, and imbraced, it will appear to have ſomething in it of Virtue and Divine force: So as that attending to the Truth and Spirit of it, in ſingleneſs and ſimplicity of Heart, it may be uſeful for Inſtructing, Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Healing thy Soul; but if Rejected or Abuſed, it will riſe up another day as a Witneſs and Judg againſt thee. Take heed therefore, good Reader, to what thou Readest, and take heed how thou Readeſt, Heareſt and Receiveſt it, not judging of its Truth and Goodneſs according to the weakneſs in Phraſe and Expreſſion, or the too many Miſ-ſpellings and Miſ-pointings in its Printing; but according to its agreement in Matter and Deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He loved, yet it's likely to retain his honour with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to avoid the ſpeech of People about him, and yet ſo much he loved him, as come to him he would, and acquaint himſelf with him, and therefore chuſes to come to him by Night rather then not to come at all. Nor doth our Saviour upbraid him with his weakneſs, or brand him as guilty of Cowardlineſs for ſo cloſe and hidden an acknowledgment of him, but bears therewith, till better knowledge of him, and more acquaintance with him might put more Courage into him, as afterward we find it did; for he durſt and did plead for him among and againſt his Enemies. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.50, 51.

Surely our Lord herein ſet us a good Example, verifying the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that went before of him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould <hi>not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the Streets; that he ſhould not break a bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoking Flax, till he bring forth judgment into victory.</hi> Iſa. 42.2, 3.

Let us incourage what is good: and bear with, and overlook the weakneſs cleaving to men therein; So did our Saviour here, taking occaſion meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inſtruct <hi>Nicodemus</hi> into that which concerned both him and us to know, <hi>viz.</hi> the neceſſity of Regeneration, without upbraiding his weakneſs in the time of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for <hi>Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto him, Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born again</hi> (or from above) <hi>he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> There is an heavenly

And the people thought it ſhould ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be manifeſted. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.11.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or from above) <hi>he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> That happy ſtate in which God more immediately ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and bearing ſway, fills thoſe that are ſubject and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his Government with Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt here; and with Life and Glory Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting in Soul and Body for ever hereafter is not to be ſeen, known, or injoyed, but by new Creatures; thoſe that are born from above. This earthly and carnal birth is ſo much defiled and uſhers in ſuch pollution of ſin and mortality becauſe of ſin, that we are not fit without another higher birth for the priviledges of Gods Kingdom, into which <hi>no unclean or unrighteous thing</hi> (as we all are by nature) may find admiſſion. In this natural birth we deſcend of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> as fallen from God, and begetting in his own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and mortal likeneſs: but its neceſſary to our injoyment of Gods Kingdom that we be born of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who begets Children in his image and likeneſs, holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53764:11"/>
ones. Birth of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> might ſuffice to give admiſſion into the outward form and court of the Church, and unto the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> but to Heaven and the joys and glory thereof, nothing but a birth from Heaven. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſtounding at this Doctrine and yet believing Chriſt to be a <hi>Teacher come from God,</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it as falſe, but inquires further into it of him who taught him it, and who he thought alſo was fitteſt to inform him further about it; and therefore asked him, how it could be. <hi>How can a man be born,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when he is old</hi> (as probably he himſelf was) <hi>can he enter into his Mothers Womb the ſecond time and be born?</hi> in which he ſhews the groſneſs of his underſtanding, as not being yet acquainted with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours manner of teaching. He its likely-thought (and not amiſs) that our Saviour meant it of ſome more unwonted thing then were the legal obſervations, or any thing they could confer on men: and whether it might be ſome ſtrange birth over again in the Fleſh, and perhaps in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (according to ſome fancies of the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> of all things after ſome long periods of time to be acted over again as before) he might not know, nor could conceive how a man could be born again, but by ſuch a reduction to his firſt entrance into the world again. But its better to ſhew our groſneſs of underſtanding, and inquire into truths propoſed to us of thoſe that teach us them though we ſpeak like fools therein; then by an over-baſhfulneſs, or a deſire to be thought wiſer then we are, to conceal our doubts; and to pretend, that we do apprehend what we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant off; for by ſo doing, we deprive our ſelves of the help and inſtruction, which by propounding our doubts (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever groſs and ignorant our propoſing of them may make us appear) might be received; and ſure, as the Apoſtle <hi>Thomas</hi> his doubting, and expreſſing his hardneſs to believe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53764:12"/>
occaſioned a more full demonſtration of the reality and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſts Reſurrection, to the great benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage not only of himſelf, but alſo of the whole Church in the preſent and following ages: So <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his doubt here, tho therein ſhewing the groſneſs of his underſtanding occaſioned and received ſuch further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction into the nature and neceſſity of Regeneration, as tended not only to his, but alſo to our greater helpfulneſs and advantage. For in <hi>ver.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> In which our Saviour ſhews, that his words are not to be groſly taken, as if he ſpake of a fleſhly birth, from the Mothers Womb, but of a Spiritual and Divine birth, the Principles whereof are Water and Spirit.

               <p>Now, whereas <hi>Nicodemus marvailed</hi> at this, as being a Doctrine he had not been before inſtructed into, our Lord therefore adds, <hi>Marvail not that I ſaid unto thee, ye muſt be born again,</hi> or from above. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth</hi> (or the Spirit breatheth where he pleaſeth) <hi>and thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the ſound of it, but thou knoweſt not whence it cometh, nor whither it. So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> There are hidden and ſtrange ſecrets in the works of God that fall under our ſenſes which paſs our skill: how much more are there wonderful things in the ſpiritual effects and products of the grace and ſpirit of God, which the natural man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend.

whence that virtue was received: or whence he was born and brought to it, and whether he and it tends.

The <hi>Phariſees</hi> could conteſt about Purifications, outward Waſhings, Sacrificings, obſervations of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and other times and places of Worſhip, and ſuch like Ceremonies: and great zeal they had to bring men to be of their mind and way in ſuch things; pretending to, and perſwading them that that way they ſhould be fit for Gods Kingdom. But our Saviour who knew all things perfectly, is for the bottom and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of all right and acceptable Religion. He knew (and taught, and ſpake what he knew) that it was in vain to endeavour to make the fruit good, while the Tree that ſhould produce it abides naught and corrupt. He bids therefore firſt, <hi>make the Tree good, and then the fruit good;</hi> becauſe <hi>a good Tree cannot bring forth bad fruit, nor a corrupt Tree good fruit.</hi> Inſtead then, of doting about queſtions, and ſtrifes of words, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Ceremonies, and ſhews, or works of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own, after the Law, which can never make us good, or fit us for the Kingdom of God; he would have us look to the main: to be made new Creatures. That is, ſo to know and mind the grace of God in Chriſt (which he after unfolds in the verſes I have pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſome that follow them) that our hearts may there-through be renewed, to love and truſt in him,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53764:14"/>
and worſhip God, in, and by him, in Spirit and Truth: otherwiſe, let their birth be what it will, their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion never ſo exactly, according to the Letter of the Law: their Baptiſms, Waſhings, and Purifications, never ſo many, or diligently made; their Sacrifices never ſo coſtly, their Faſts never ſo frequent, their Prayers never ſo long, or fervent; their outward walkings among men never ſo blameleſs and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: yet, without a new Heart and Spirit, made ſo by the grace of God, diſcerned and imbraced, and his Spirit there-through in his operations and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies complied with all, would avail nothing to the injoyment of Gods Kingdom. And this is very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be minded by us, and the truth and certainty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of inculcated, and Chriſt and his holy Servants to be liſtned to in it, as Teachers that knew, and were certain of what they taught: and not the <hi>blind followed,</hi> that grope at things as in the dark; and who, while they <hi>would be teachers of the Law know not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm.</hi> Who as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lay out money for that which is not bread, and their labour</hi> and ſtrength <hi>for that which ſatisfieth not.</hi> Iſa. 55.2. <hi>Dote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about queſtions and ſtrifes of words, of which come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and perverſe diſputes, to no godly edifying:</hi> Or leading men to walk in a road of Practices, Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Performances of External duties without the Root, the <hi>great myſtery of godlineſs,</hi> the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, perception, and receit of the grace of God in Chriſt, ſo as to the renewing them in the Spirit of their mind, about which, there is in many, both Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Profeſſors of Religion, exceeding great blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thence incertainty, and confuſion in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions: <hi>The labour of the fooliſh wearying every one
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53764:14"/>
of them, becauſe they know not the way into the City.</hi> Eccleſ. 10.15. Much zeal there is, and may be about the outward form and time of Baptiſme, the manner and way of Praying, receit of the Supper, or Communion, Hearing, Faſting, the times and places of Worſhip, with its Formes and Ceremonies; yea, and about walking in divers Religious practices, when yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, pride and arrogancy, confidence in our ſelves, our own frames or works, with unbelief, and rejection of the Grace and Truth of God; Deſpiſing, Hating, and even Perſecuting men, becauſe differing in their modes and apprehenſions: Envy, Malice, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Fraud, and ſuch like things, lurk and bear ſway underneath. And yet men are apt to think, all is well with them, and incourage themſelves, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to expect Gods Kingdom. <hi>Crying, Peace, peace,</hi> where God ſpeaks not peace, <hi>and healing the hurts ſlightly</hi> that ſhould be made ſound; like thoſe in <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miahs</hi> days, that thought their having Gods Temple and Worſhip among them, ſhould ſecure them from Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though their hearts were uncircumciſed, and their ways and doings naught and unmended. But its good to take heed to ſound Doctrine; the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones, taught and inſtructed by him; for they <hi>ſpake what they knew, and teſtified what they ſee,</hi> not ſtearing our courſe by the multitude, for ſo we ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters of the Truth. For Chriſts Doctrine was not ſo crouded after, as to be heartily imbraced, by the moſt, for then would he not have ſaid, <hi>We ſpeak what we know, and teſtifie what we have ſeen, and no man receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our teſtimony;</hi> wherein after ſignification of his own, and his holy Servants fitneſs for teaching others,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53764:15"/>
and faithfulneſs in teaching, he faults and complains of the too great want of credit to, and receit of their faithful teachings by the generality of men: which he yet ſignifyeth to be the more inexcuſable, becauſe he ſpake but hitherto of things <hi>Earthly</hi> or done upon earth, and therefore thence argues, their greater unfitneſs, and incapacity for <hi>Heavenly</hi> things more properly, and in a fuller ſenſe ſuch. <hi>If I have told you Earthly things, and ye believe not, how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of Heavenly? v.</hi> 12. As implying alſo, his fitneſs and ability, for declaring the heavenly things (the things done or to be done in Heaven) alſo. Yea, and he further ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his only fitneſs and ſufficiency for declaring them, in what he adds, <hi>viz.</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>And no man hath aſcended up into Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man who is in Heaven.</hi> Signifying as his own deſcent from, and yet being in Heaven: ſo that none but He, <hi>That Son of Man,</hi> is fit or able to declare the things of Heaven, becauſe none elſe came down thence furniſhed with the Knowledge of them.</p>
               <p>And whereas, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> might ſtill be more ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at theſe intimations of his coming down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, aſcending up to Heaven, and being in Heaven, even while he ſee and heard him on the Earth, ſpeaking to him, he adds the words of the Text. <hi>And as</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up; that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh but have eternal life.</hi> Of which he gives the reaſon in the next <hi>verſes. For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life, &amp;c.</hi> Whence we may note by the way, that Chriſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53764:15"/>
did not for Regenerating <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> Preach to him ſome particular love, or ſpecial manifeſtation of it to him, more than to others; but generally, love or grace, even the love of God to the World. As the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo tells us, that, that which ſaved him, and others from their natural and ſinful ſtate, was the <hi>appearance of the love, and pity of God to mankind.</hi> Tit. 3.3, 4. He ſaith not, it was ſome peculiar love to them, more then to others that was made to appear, as the object upon which their eyes and hearts were faſtned; but the love of God to man more indefinitely and generally. And therefore they are not to be heard, who, rejecting the Teſtimony of Gods love and grace to mankind, and to the World, make it their firſt and main buſineſs to Preach, ſpecial and particular love to ſome elect and choſen ones, as the way to bring Souls in to God. Let us follow the way our Saviour hath walked in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; Preach to men Gods good will and love, as teſtifyed to all in general in the gift of Chriſt, and leave it to God to bear teſtimony to the word of his grace, and to work therewith; opening their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and perſwading their hearts to imbrace it, and evidencing and bearing witneſs to them, as he who knows their hearts ſees good. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.3. &amp; 15.8.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the thing it ſelf. It is ſaid to have been a Serpent; not a living Serpent, nor the carcaſe of ſuch a Creature dead, but a Serpent in figure, or Reſemblance, a Serpent of Braſs, as the Scripture calls it. <hi>Num.</hi> 21.9. Moſes <hi>made a Serpent of Braſs and ſet it up, &amp;c.</hi> though in verſ. 6. Its called a <hi>fiery Serpent.</hi> That is, the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of ſuch a kind of Serpent as is ſo called. From this, we might by the way obſerve, That in Gods Ordinances, Sacraments (and ſometimes otherwiſe, or in other caſes) the Figures, Reſemblances, Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls, and Significations of things, are called in the Scriptures by the names of the things reſembled or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by them. So we find Angels appearing like men, often called men. <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.3, 6, 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.2, 5. With <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.4.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.10. The Altar erected as a medium of Worſhipping God, called by the name (though not tranſubſtantiated into the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence) of the <hi>Lord God of</hi> Iſrael. Gen. 33.20. The Paſchal Lamb called the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> becauſe a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Gods paſſing over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he deſtroyed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53764:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Bread</hi> in the Lords Supper called, <hi>the Body of Chriſt;</hi> and the <hi>Cup, the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his blood,</hi> becauſe ſignifications, and in a ſort exhibitions of them <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the further uſe of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, as to the Matter lifted up, we may by and by conſider, when we have taken in the next particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The reaſon of its ſetting up; and that is two wayes conſiderable. <hi>Viz.</hi> as to
<list>
                     <item>1. The end of its being ſet up, and therein the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereof.</item>
                     <item>2. The original of its being, ſet up for that end, or the authority by which it was ſet up.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The end of its being ſet up, was in order to the healing, or preſerving from death the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when for their murmuring againſt God, and deſpiſing the Manna, or bread from Heaven, wherewith he fed them; he had ſent fiery flying Serpents among the People that bit ſome of them ſo, as that they dyed. As is related in <hi>Num.</hi> 21.6. A ſimple thing to appearance, to be of uſe in ſuch a caſe, and yet to that uſe it was made and ſet up, with this promiſe annexed, that <hi>it ſhould come to paſs, that when a Serpent bit any man who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it was, he looking to that Serpent of Braſs ſhould live.</hi> ver. 8. And ſuch were its effects as appears <hi>ver.</hi> 9. And that becauſe of the original of its being made, and ſet up to that end, which was the Lord himſelf. It was by his appointment and command. <hi>Moſes</hi> though King in <hi>Jeſurun,</hi> yet did not order the people after his own will, nor appoint them Ordinances and inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his own head: but depended on God for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and propoſed to them, what he appointed them. Note hence, that its not for men (though never ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53764:17"/>
great Magiſtrates, or of never ſo great Authority in the Church) of their own heads to make, and erect means and ordinances of Salvation: nor ſignificant Sacraments in Gods Church, in the uſe of which, men may and are to expect bleſſing: but this is Gods, and Chriſts Prerogative. As men can give no bleſſing with their inſtitutions; ſo neither can they make Ordinances for God to bleſs, or promiſe Gods bleſſing with them they make, that men in the uſe of them may wait with confidence, and good ground for it, therein. Its Gods part to appoint the <hi>mediums</hi> which we are to make uſe of as Sacraments, or divine Ordinances; and promiſe, and give bleſſing in the due uſe of them, according to his appointment: and in ſuch <hi>mediums</hi> we may expect and find bleſſing, no matter how unlikely, or homely be their matter. God who hath the ſole power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting Ordinances and means of bleſſing, hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give bleſſing, with, or by what means he pleaſeth. If he bid, ſet up a piece of Braſs, and direct a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creature to behold it, and promiſe healing to the beholder by it, it is enough to ingage him to look to it, in ſuch a caſe, and to expect benefit by it, according to his promiſe. Nor ſhall ſuch uſe of it, or expectation of help thereby be fruſtrate. If he bid a Leprous man go waſh in <hi>Jordan</hi> ſeven times, and he ſhall be clean, he is to be obeyed, and healing in that way is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, nor ſhall it be miſſed: though thoſe waters in themſelves be nothing better than others, which never ſo often waſhed in, have no ſuch effects. If Chriſt make clay with his ſpittle and annoint a mans eyes with it that was born blind, and bid him go and waſh in a pool of water, its good to obey him, for he is able to give ſight thereby; whereas, others uſing the ſame,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53764:18"/>
or like means, without his Authority an hundred times over may remain ſtill blind.</p>
               <p>If he appoint us to be Baptized with Water into his Name for the remiſſion of our ſins, and receipt of his holy Spirit, it is not in vain to practice it; yea, it is a ſin, and ſuch, as in which we deprive our ſelves of the benefit, if we refuſe it. And if he bid us take and bleſs, and break, and eat a loafe, or a piece of bread, in his Name, and in the remembrance of his love to, and ſufferings for us; and to drink a cup of Wine to the ſame purpoſe, and it ſhall be to us his Body and Blood; or a Communion of them: its not good to diſpute, or deſpiſe his Ordinances, becauſe of the meanneſs of their viſible matter, but obey and obſerve his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For this we may alſo hence <hi>note,</hi> That the efficacy or bleſſing of Gods Ordinances, depend not on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, or meanneſs of their outward matter. He gives forth <hi>his treaſures in earthy Veſſels,</hi> and makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt <hi>his Power in</hi> very <hi>weakneſs;</hi> makes <hi>the fooliſhneſs of the Preaching of the Croſs the power and wiſdom of God to Salvation to them that believe it.</hi> Therefore its not good ſo ſay (as the Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> when God having Anointed him, they deſpiſed him, and ſent him no preſents, <hi>How can this man ſave us?</hi> ſo) how can this water waſh away our ſins? or this bread and wine nouriſh our Souls, or promote our eternal Life? for as there it was not the man that ſaved, but the power of God with him, that made him an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al mean, or inſtrument of conveying his Salvation as to deliverance from their Enemies: So here its not the outward <hi>mediums</hi> of Water, Bread, and Wine; yea, or of the words, but the power and appointment of him that appointed them, as <hi>mediums</hi> of holding forth his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53764:18"/>
grace and bleſſing to the duty-waiter upon him, in them, that gives the promiſed efficacies and bleſſings by them, or in the uſe of them. We may, and ought then to attend upon Gods Ordinances whatſoever they be, and expect his preſence and promiſed bleſſing, in, and by them. But ſo we neither may nor can by mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and human inſtitutions. God or Chriſt have not forbidden us, to ſet up Golden, Wooden, Brazen, or Silver Croſſes, to mind us of the Croſs of Chriſt; or repreſent him to us, by drawing curious Pictures, or making Statues for reſembling him to us: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch things, or any of no higher Original, or greater Authority then ſo (as mens deviſed holy Bread, holy Water, Oyl, Cream, Spittle, Croſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) may we not look for, or expect his bleſſing, and preſence with us. Gods inſtitution, command, and promiſe gives any thing, to which they are annexed the virtue to be expected; and upon thoſe grounds ſuch things are to be uſed according to his appointment. I ſay, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his appointment; becauſe, when even ſuch things are otherwiſe uſed, they may become rather hurts than helps unto us: as we have an inſtance in this <hi>Brazen Serpent.</hi> God commanded it, and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet it up at his commandment, to be a <hi>medium</hi> of conveying, healing to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were wounded; not to be worſhiped or cenſed, either by perſons wounded or heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but to be looked to, by the wounded, in order to their being healed. And therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did well, and its reckoned amongſt his good acts, that he <hi>pulled down this Brazen Serpent and brake it in pieces</hi> when the people went a whoring after it, and burnt incenſe to it. See 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4. And ſurely to bowe down to, and worſhip the <hi>mediums,</hi> or matters of Gods Ordinances,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53764:19"/>
appointed only to be <hi>mediums</hi> of our remembring, and worſhiping him, is a great abuſe of them; much more, to worſhip ſuch things as have only mans authority and not Gods, in their inſtitution and impoſing, as Croſſes, Altars, Temples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as thoſe things be hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable: ſo alſo, <hi>Note,</hi> That God is good, to them that wait upon and follow him, though he ſometime pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them for their neglects of him; and unbelief, and diſtruſt in him; unthankfulneſs for his benefits, or diſobedience to his Commands; yet he is both loving to, and careful of them, in their obeying &amp; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. Yea, to thoſe alſo, who, having moved him to anger, and to puniſh them for their ſins, are by his puniſhments awakned to Repentance, and brought to humble themſelves before him for their offences: and that is evident here, in that, when the people ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by their murmurings againſt him, provoked him, and he had puniſhed them with fiery Serpents that bit and wounded them; yet when they turned again and humbled themſelves, and got <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for them, upon his praying for them, God appoints them this way of preſervation. He undertook to be their Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, as well as their feeder; to heal them, as well as to nouriſh them. And yet its worthy our not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing. That God did not grant the very thing they deſired, but what he ſee good to grant them, and what might be better for them, then what they deſired. The thing which they deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to Pray for was, That God would take away the Serpents: God takes not away the Serpents, but provides a means of preſervation, in caſe they were bitten by them. He yet continues the chaſtiſement, to mind them of their ſin, and to nurture them to ſtand in awe of him: which probably had he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53764:19"/>
removed the affliction and danger, they would ſoon have ceaſed from. And yet he takes care, that in obeying him, and his appointment, they might in ſuch caſes of ſuffering be kept from periſhing thereby; and therefore appoints a means to cure and heal them. God is gracious to hear the cries of his poor humbled, and penitent people; though he doth not always grant the very thing they deſire of him. We are apt to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Fleſh, more then the Spirit; and the things of Man, more then the things of God, in our afflictions &amp; deſires of help in them. But God conſults the good and profit of our Souls, more then the eaſe of our Bodies, in his gracious anſwers to us: we are too apt to be of this peoples ſtrain in our deſires in ſuch caſes. Lord, take away theſe Serpents. Or as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> pray to God, that theſe Frogs, or Locuſts may depart from us; or that he will take away this pain, ſickneſs, or the like. Being more ſenſible of the trouble of Gods Chaſtiſements, then of the ſins that occaſioned them, or apt to believe the good end of God in ordering them, and the profit to us, that he aims at in them: or then we are deſirous to be rid of the ſin, and to be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the profit. And truly Gods dear children are too apt to be led by ſenſe in their deſires in ſuch caſes; as we may perceive in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in what he relates of himſelf, till Chriſt had better inſtructed him. When God after he had rapt him up into the third Heavens, had ordered to him <hi>a thorne in the Fleſh, a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Satan to buffet him, least he ſhould be puffed up,</hi> or <hi>be exalted above meaſure, through the abundance of the Revelations</hi> given him; he was weary of that exerciſe, and therefore prayed thrice to the Lord, that it <hi>might depart from him.</hi> But after that, Chriſt had told him,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53764:20"/>
that his <hi>grace was ſufficient for him,</hi> then he could <hi>moſt gladly rejoyce in tribulations, infirmities, neceſſities,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. Chriſt dealt with him there in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, as God dealt with theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> here. He took not away the thorne in the fleſh; the grief and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe that he complained of, as he deſired of him: but he ſupplied him with his grace to bear it, and receive profit by it. Even as here he took not away the Serpents, but cauſed a medecine to be prepared for them, and propoſed to them, againſt the deadly hurt of them, becauſe he ſaw it might be more for their good and profit, to be exerciſed ſtill with them; that in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, they might more prove his power, and the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of his grace for them; learn to hope in him, ſtand in awe of him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is it not ſo with us, as with them, when God tries us with ſickneſs, or pain, or bad neighbours, or unkindneſs in, and from Relations? Oh, how fain would we be rid of theſe troubles; we are all for this, <hi>take away theſe Serpents.</hi> Theſe exerciſes and afflictions; but learn we here to know, that God is good to us, and will do us good in our turning and ſeeking to him, though he anſwer us not juſt to our deſires. He ſees afflictions and temptations (be they what they will) may be needful and behooful to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to us. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. They have not yet perhaps had the end, and effect in us, and produced the good to us he ſent them for. He may ſee, were they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, we would then grow neglectful or forgetful of him; or grow worldly, carnal, careleſs, wanton, kick againſt him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore having given us an Antidote againſt the evil and deſtructiveneſs of them, in his Son, and his Word as ſetting him before us, he pleaſeth ſtill to continue them to us. It is better for us
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53764:20"/>
in ſuch caſes, to imitate our pattern the Lord Jeſus; who, when he was to drink that bitter Cup which his Father gave him to drink, did not pray abſolutely, that he might not drink it, or that it might paſs from him: but with a thorough reſignation of himſelf to his Fathers will, prayed; <hi>Father if it be poſſible let this Cup paſs from me, nevertheleſs, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But view we now, the perſon ſetting it up, and that was <hi>Moſes,</hi> concerning whom, I ſhall only note his obedience in doing Gods Commandement without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting it: He ſaid not, how can a piece of Braſs, made in the likeneſs of a <hi>Fiery Serpent</hi> heal them? or would it not be better, that the people look only to thee for their healing, then to direct their eyes to any ſuch <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums</hi> whereby they may be moved to aſcribe their healing, or preſervation, to the <hi>medium;</hi> rather then to thy ſelf!

The way to know our way, is to mind his Word; even his way, that leads to his heavenly reſt, and eternal Kingdom, is a way that lies out of the road of the world, a way of exerciſe for faith; a way of trials and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And yet, as God in that Wilderneſs, ſhewed himſelf alſufficient for his people, provided for them bread, and water, clothes, and phyſick, or a way to cure their wounds, and prevent their periſhing: So God is alſufficient for us too in all our trials and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and hath provided for us, all grace and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Chriſt Jeſus; and will not fail to diſpence it, to them whoſe hearts are perfect with him. <hi>For the Lord God is a Sun and a Shield.

               <p>THE Second point is, That the Son of Man muſt be lifted up. To which Point, the other two may alſo be reduced, they holding forth but the <hi>way</hi> wherein (or <hi>manner</hi> after which) and <hi>the end,</hi> to which he is to be lifted up. In ſpeaking to this Second Point, we may conſider,

                     <item>1. Who is meant here by the <hi>Son of Man.</hi>
                     </item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Who is this Son of Man? or who is meant and pointed at by that phraſe or Title; and that appears every where in the wrightings of the Evangeliſts, to be no other then he, who ſpake; even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. And ſo both other expreſſions of the Evangeliſts, and thoſe that are about this Text do evidence. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, For other expreſſions, we have our Saviour himſelf, as related in <hi>Matthew,</hi> plainly ſignifying it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.13. For, there the Evangeliſt tells us, That Jeſus asked his Diſciples, <hi>Whom do men ſay, that I the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53764:22"/>
Son of man am?</hi> plainly calling himſelf <hi>the Son of Man</hi> As alſo in the ſame Chapter <hi>ver.</hi> 27. Saying, <hi>The Son of Man ſhall come in the glory of his Father with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and then he ſhall render to every one according to his Works.</hi> But he that ſhall come with his Angels, and whoſe Father God is, and ſhall come to Judge the World, and ſhall render to every one according to his Works, is evidently aſſerted to be the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. See for that. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.42. &amp; 17.31. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For expreſſions about the Text. In the verſe before, the <hi>Son of Man</hi> is ſaid to be, He that Deſcended and came down from Heaven, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up into Heaven, and is in Heaven. But none hath done ſo, and is ſo, but Jeſus Chriſt. Yea, and in the very next verſe it appears, that He who is here called the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> is there called, <hi>The only begotten Son of God.</hi> For, whereas it is here ſaid, That <hi>the Son of Man muſt be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth on him might not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> It follows in the next verſe, as the reaſon hereof. <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son; that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Now certain it is, That God hath not deſigned two diſtinct objects of Faith; or two diſtinct Saviours to be believed on, and to be the givers of Eternal life, but only one; and that is his Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, there <hi>being Salvation in no other, nor any other name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven under Heaven, whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> Act. 4.11, 12. They are then the ſame. the <hi>Son of Man.</hi> And the <hi>only begotten Son of God.</hi> The only begotten <hi>Son of God,</hi> therefore is the <hi>Son of Man:</hi> thats the Perſon here meant of, and called ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53764:23"/>2. But then the reaſon, why he is called, or rather calls himſelf ſo, is worthy to be inquired into, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. For we do not find the Evangeliſts, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles any where ſo to call him, when they ſpeak of him; but they uſually call him <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth. Mark.</hi> 10.47. &amp; 16.6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.22. Or the <hi>Lord Jeſus. Luk.</hi> 24.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.21. &amp; 4.33. Or ſimply <hi>the Lord.</hi> Luk. 7.31. &amp; 11.39. Or <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. Mat.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.1. <hi>John.</hi> 1.17. Or <hi>Jeſus which is called the Chriſt.</hi> Mat. 1.16, Or <hi>Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi> Mat. 16.16. Or <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Acts 15.11, 26. But he often and uſually ſpeaking of himſelf, calls himſelf the <hi>Son of Man;</hi> as is eaſie to obſerve, in reading the Evangeliſts. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this may be manifold, as</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. That he calls himſelf the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> might be to ſhew us (and ſet us an example of) his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; and to inſtruct us how to withſtand, and be kept free from temptations to pride, and high-mindedneſs; to which, <hi>Sathan</hi> is ready to tempt us from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any priviledges, or more excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beſtowed upon us. It is an evident thing, that we are very prone to lift up our ſelves, in the view, or conceit of any thing, almoſt either inward or outward, wherein we differ from, ſo as to appear better therein, then others. If it be but a better ſuite of Apparel, or Hair, or Stature, or Beauty, or Strength, or Eſtate, or Birth, we are apt to know our ſelves by them, and to think ſo much the goodlier of our ſelves, and carry our ſelves above, or loftily towards others that are, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear inferiour to us in ſuch things; how much more if we be more honoured, or honourable, be in greater office or place among men? have better gifts or parts? Yea,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53764:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the very works of righteouſneſs wrought by us, or the Revelations of Myſteries, and great things to us, reflected on by us, are apt to puff us up, as is implyed, both in the pride of the <hi>Phariſees truſting in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſing others.</hi> Luk. 18.9. And that admonition given to the believing <hi>Gentiles, Not to be high-minded, but fear,</hi> When they conſider Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, and their better ſtate then that of the unbelieving, and in part rejected <hi>Jews.</hi> Rom. 11.21, 22. and by what the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf. viz. <hi>Leaſt through the abundance of Revelations given him, he ſhould be exalted above meaſure</hi> there was <hi>given him a thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. Now as God out of faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to, and care of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to prevent his being lifted up, when he had ſeen the <hi>Viſions of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the God of Iſrael.</hi> Chap. 1. &amp; 3. &amp; 8. &amp;. 10. <hi>&amp;c,</hi> And the Viſions of the re-edification of the Church and Temple of God, and of the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> alwaies I think in his ſpeaking to him, calls him <hi>Son of Man</hi> as is to be ſeen in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 1, 3, 4, 10, 17, 25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, its uſed in that Prophecy in Gods ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Prophet, at leaſt ninety times; whereas, its never uſed to any of the Prophets elſe, except once to <hi>Daniel</hi> (who alſo had diverſe great Viſions of things to come ſhewed to him) <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.17. Even as for the like cauſe or reaſon; namely, to prevent his being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above meaſure, through the abundance of the Revelations given him, he <hi>gave</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul a thorn in the fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan to buffet him.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea, and being indued with ſuch power and authority to do great Miracles and Wonders, and doing them alſo, ſuch as never any before him did: Yea, both ſo ſpeaking, and ſpeaking ſuch things (<hi>Joh.</hi> 7.46. &amp; 15.22) and doing ſuch works, and therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that wonderful benefit and advantage to the World as never any beſide (mighty occaſions for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than to find matter for tempting to pride, and high-mindedneſs; and to carry himſelf loftily above all others.) He to ſhew his humility, and lowlineſs of mind and heart in the greatneſs of his honour, and theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold occaſions of temptation to high-mindedneſs, ſtiles himſelf (as God ſtiled that Prophet, to keep him low and humble (as the greatneſs of Chriſts humility was alſo ſhewed in his being ſo) <hi>the Son of Man.</hi> Not, that Chriſt had as man that corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him, as <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> and other holy men had, that he ſhould need to uſe ſuch expreſſions to keep down that corruption from working in him, as they, and we need to have it kept down and mortified. For <hi>he knew no ſin</hi> though he was <hi>made in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. Rom. 8.3. He was the <hi>ſpotleſs

Even to worſhip the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for the injoyment of the glory and Kingdoms of this World. And though we find no mention of any temptations, but what was there ſpecified after his Baptiſme, and before his Preaching; yet in ſaying there, that the Tempter left him <hi>for a ſeaſon</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or till an opportunity) it is implyed, that he was not without temptations at other after-times, and in other particulars alſo. And ſo having ſo great occaſions (as before is ſaid) for Sathan to take hold of, he might have ſuch darts caſt at him too, as motions to pride and haughtineſs. Yea, ſuch a temptation alſo may I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive be apprehended to have been incluſively in that ſaying to him, <hi>If thou beeſt the Son of God, command that theſe Stones be made bread.</hi> And in, <hi>caſt thy ſelf down from the Pinacle of the Temple,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 4.56. And as in thoſe temptations mentioned, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. Our Saviour did not barely by his Authority and Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke Sathan, but propoſed to himſelf, and made uſe of ſuch conſideration, and allegation of the Law and Doctrine of the Lord, as was proper to reſiſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf from yeilding to thoſe temptations; and ſuch as in ſuch caſes minded by us, would preſerve us alſo; ſuch as, <hi>It is written, man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word proceeding out of the mouth of God.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53764:25"/>
to. As alſo, He did and ſaid many things, not ſo much for his own need, as to give us an example, that we might follow his ſteps. And ſo he might and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us hereby, that we ſhould avoid pride in any thing, wherein we differ from, and excel others, and that it's a good-way for avoiding it, to conſider what we are as to our worſer ſtate, that is, as to our Natures in themſelves as fallen conſidered, and as we find, ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us, or have committed ſins: for though we be rich, honourable, ſtrong, beautiful, of good witt and parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet we are men, Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> begot, and brought forth in his Image and likeneſs; and ſo are mortal, ſinful, and in our ſelves miſerable; thoſe things notwithſtanding. Yea, though Noble born, or deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, of Religious Parents: though we have the Law, or Doctrine of God, and skill, and knowledge therein, and many righteous frames and works thereby, and thereafter; yet this is Gods gift, if there be any thing, or as to all things, really good therein; we yet are in, and of our ſelves Men; mortal, ſinful, unworthy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Yea, though we are called of God to Chriſt, and in him owned of God, and become his Children; accepted and bleſſed in him; and indued with many ſingular gifts and priviledges: yet for all that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fleſh, we are men, ſons of men, infirm, mortal, ſinful; and what we are in Chriſt, we are it meerly and freely by grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt. And we have no cauſe to lift up, or boaſt our ſelves, becauſe thereof, becauſe we received it of grace; only God and Chriſt are to be glorified therein. Yea, and by how much the more any man is benefited, and priviledged of, and by the Lord, ſo much is He the more obliged for it to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53764:25"/>
Lord. Certainly, we find the holy men of God, in their injoyments of favour and grace, from, and with God, and honours with him, to exerciſe their minds to ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and humillity in themſelves, from the conſideration of what they were in, and of themſelves; or by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Corruption before ſuch grace or honour beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them. So we find <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured him, as not to hide from him, the thing he intended toward <hi>Sodom,</hi> but to acquaint him with it, and admit him, to plead with him, and make interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them; thus depreſſing himſelf, <hi>Suffer me that am but Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> Gen. 18.27. And when <hi>David</hi> had been bleſſing the Lord, as his ſtrength, goodneſs, fortreſs, and for his great benefits beſtowed upon him; leaſt he ſhould be lifted up, or be thought to have had this favour of the Lord beſtowed upon him, for any goodneſs in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he adds, <hi>Lord, what is man that thou regardeſt him, or the Son of Man, that thou makeſt account of him? Man is like to vanity, his days are like a ſhadow.</hi> Pſal. 144.3.4. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the grace beſtowed upon him, and the favour ſhewed him of God and Chriſt, in counting him faithful, and calling him to be an Apoſtle; uſually takes this courſe (to hide Pride from himſelf) to confeſs what he had been, and was, when Chriſt came upon him, to convince and convert him, and take him into that dignity. <hi>Viz.</hi> That he <hi>was a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and a Blaſphemer, and Injurious, not worthy to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe he had Perſecuted the Church of God.</hi> Yea, therefore he ſtiles himſelf <hi>the leaſt of all Saints;</hi> yea, <hi>the chief of Sinners.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.8, 9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.23, 14, 15. That ſo he might the more magnifie the grace of God and Chriſt; and being ſenſible of his own demerit, and unworthineſs in himſelf, be the more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53764:26"/>
low and humble: the more diligent, and obedient in ſervice, more compaſſionate over others, though ſinners; yea, more ready to every good work. And ſo Chriſt here, and his Servants ought to be imitated by us, in avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pride and high-mindedneſs, and in exerciſing our ſelves to humility and lowlineſs. Learn we of Chriſt <hi>who was meek and lowly, that we may find reſt unto our Souls.</hi> Mat. 11.29. That's the firſt reaſon.</p>

Secondly, he is called <hi>the Son of Man:</hi> not only of ſome particular man, or of the Father of ſome particular branch, or family of men; as to ſay, the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or of <hi>Heber,</hi> or of <hi>Shem,</hi> or of <hi>David,</hi> or the like: though it's true, he was the Son of all thoſe perſons, as to deſcent of his fleſh. Yea, and he is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſtiled the <hi>Son of Abraham;</hi> to ſignifie, that he is, and was that Seed promiſed to him; and ſo the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in whom the bleſſing for all Nations was prepared. And the <hi>Son of David</hi> to ſignifie, that he was, and is, the Heir of the Kingdom that God ſpoke of in his Oath and Covenant to <hi>David.</hi> Mat. 1.1. But that's not the title that he ever gives himſelf: but ſpeaking of himſelf, both here, and often beſides, he ſtiles himſelf <hi>The Son of Man:</hi> which word <hi>man,</hi> is not appropriated and limited to any one Perſon, or Family, or condition of men, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men. And may he not herein alſo imply, that he came, and was born into the World, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, general, and univerſal benefit of Mankind And that ſo far, as the nature of Man extendeth; ſo far hath he relation and favour; ſo as for the good of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he came in, and ſtands to, the nature of man (and not only of this, or that perſon of it) in the notion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and affection of a Son. And ſo we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that ſaying, of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 9.6. <hi>To</hi>

So much leſs was he for Salvation to them only, but to be alſo <hi>a light to lighten the Gentiles</hi> (as a Son or Child is called, <hi>a Light or Lamp</hi> to the Parents, or Family. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.36. &amp; 15, 4.) And to be <hi>for Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</hi> Luk. 2.32. Iſa. 49.6. And ſo a Child born <hi>To</hi> (or for) mankind, <hi>the Son of Man;</hi> as owning Man generally in a larger ſenſe, as his Mother; though in a choice ſenſe, or more Spiritually, they only are ſo, that hear the Word of God and do it. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.21. He is ſo given to man, and owns a Relation to Man, as that he is <hi>the Saviour of all men; eſpecially, of thoſe that believe.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.10. And ſo he puts an honour and dignity upon the Nature of Man, though in a ſpecial ſenſe, he is <hi>the glory of his people Iſrael;</hi> As before. Both as to <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, as after the fleſh he came of them; and alſo (and moſt eſpecially, and chiefly) of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Spirit; whoſe Saviour and Portion in the moſt full and choice ſence, he is for ever. But I ſay, his being made Man, puts an honour upon the Nature of Man, and ſhews him to be a lover of Man; even of that Nature, and Creature above all others (even Angels too, whoſe Nature he took not. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16.) And that his delight <hi>is with the Sons of Men.</hi> As is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53764:27"/>
For as it was a great honour, that man was made in the Image and likeneſs of his Maker: So it was a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſhewed yet more reſpect to Man, and his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that God, even the Word, which was, and is God, the Son of God, and Mans Maker (<hi>For all things were made by him.</hi> Joh. 1.2.) Should be made in <hi>the likeneſs of men, and in the habit of a man.</hi> Phil. 2.7, 8. Though (as it's twice ſaid, ſo its twice true, with reſpect to either <hi>Adam</hi>) that <hi>Man being in honour and without understanding</hi> (or not conſidering to walk worthy of it) <hi>becomes like</hi> (or is compared) <hi>to the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> Pſal. 49.12, 20. But ſure it's a great priviledge to our nature, to have ſuch a Son begotten on, and brought forth by it, and to it as it were. And he being alſo the <hi>Son of the Father in love and Truth;</hi> full of goodneſs, righteouſneſs, and charity. What may not men expect from him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Brethren (For ſo he <hi>is not aſhamed to call us</hi>) from ſuch a Son, from ſuch a Brother, who is alſo the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Father</hi> (and ſo <hi>the wonderful one</hi>) ready to cheriſh and provide for us for ever? Sure he will, and doth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both his Father and Mother; both God his Father, and the man-hood, or man as his Mother; as in doing all things to his glory and renown; ſo in doing what may be for her; that is, mans honour, ſupport and benefit. Whatever a poor, decayed, decrepid Mother may expect from a loving Child, that's rich and honourable, for her maintainance and ſupport: man may expect from this <hi>Son of Man;</hi> yea, in him the honour and dignity conferred upon the nature of Man in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is fully, and with advantage reſtored. And that which was truly affirmable of us, in that firſt <hi>Adam; Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the Son of man, that thou viſiteſt him? for thou haſt made him a little
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53764:27"/>
lower then the Angels, thou haſt, crowned him with glory and honour; thou madeſt him to have dominion over the works of thine hands: thou haſt put all things under his feet, &amp;c.</hi> Is now applyed to man in Chriſt Jeſus, with advantage I ſay becauſe <hi>Angels, and Authorities, and Powers are</hi> alſo <hi>made ſubject to him.</hi> Pſal. 8.4, 5. With <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. And what ever poor and periſhing Brethren may hope for, from a rich and powerful Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is good and righteous, that may men expect from Chriſt the <hi>Son of Man;</hi> only as in caſe, ſuch a Mother, and Brethren be unruly proud, ſcornful; refuſe to be helped by, or receive relief from, and be beholden to ſuch a Son, or Brother, in ſuch a way as is juſt, and honourable to Himſelf, and to his Father; but will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rejecting his help, ſhirk elſewhere through their ſtubborneſs, contempt and ſcorn, they may ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſo is it with man here. But becauſe his delight is with the Sons of men, as his Brethren; and he loves, and honours the nature of man, as his Mother in a ſort, therefore he calls to men, and counſels them to be ruled by him, that he might, by relieving them, make them happy. As it is ſaid, <hi>Doth not wiſdom cry, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding lift up her voice?</hi> As who would ſay, can that be denied or doubted of? ſurely no, it's a matter beyond controverſie. <hi>She ſtands upon the top of high places</hi> (where ſhe may with the moſt, and greateſt audibleneſs, and advantage call) <hi>by the way, in the places of the paths.</hi> She is not far from any one of us, but in all mens ways, and walkings (though ſhe walk not with them, nor can go in their paths) ſhe is by her Spirit ſtriving in man, judging, reproving, and calling to him. <hi>She cryeth at the Gates, at the entry of the City.</hi> As, and when men come to the years of diſcretion, and are entring, as it were into the World,

And having ſaid, <hi>Her delights are with the Sons of men.</hi> She adds, <hi>Now therefore ye Children hearken unto me, bleſſed are they that keep my words.</hi> ver. 31, 32. Any of mans nature, during the day of grace and patience, may in liſtning to, and obeying his Councels, expect, and hope for ſuccour and bleſſing from this excellent perſon, he being the <hi>Son of Man</hi> indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely conſidered (yea, and ſuch a Son, as hath alſo the relation of a Father, Brother, Friend to us) and not of this, or that man only. That's a Second Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. A Third may be this, that he ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not only <hi>a Son of Man.</hi> For ſo any of us may do, we being all of us Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> deſcended, and ſprung out of his Loyns: as the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> ſtiles us, when he ſaith, <hi>O Sons of men, how long will ye change my glory into ſhame? how long will ye love vanity, and follow after leaſings?</hi> Pſa. 4.2. But <hi>the Son of Man;</hi> emphatically, and in a choiſe and peculiar ſenſe, the moſt excellent <hi>Son of Man;</hi> who is ſuch a <hi>Son of Man,</hi> as there is none other beſides, like to him. The <hi>Son,</hi> the Heir of Man. He to whom all his Inheritance falls. But what is that which man hath to leave, or bequeath to him? or that he could fall Heir to, by being his Son. Surely, man is become ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poor; that he can leave him, or conveigh to him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of worth; no riches, or excellency by which he might be benefited by him, as he had from God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53764:28"/>
Yet, being the Son, he is the heir of Man, as well as of God. <hi>If Sons, then Heirs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. And ſo, as Chriſt is the Son of God, he is the Heir of God; <hi>the Heir of all things.</hi> Heb. 1.2. The inheritor of his Fathers Riches, Power, Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as he is the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he is Heir of his Covenant, <hi>Heir of the World.</hi> Rom. 4.13. And as the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the Heir of his Throne, and Kingdom; which therefore God will give him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.32. <hi>The Lord God will give him the Throne of his Father David.</hi> So as the <hi>Son of Man</hi> generally, and indefinitely, what Inherits he, but what Man <hi>(Adam)</hi> left as a natural Heritage, ſo far, as was derivable to him? That is his great debt that he fell into, even his ſin, as to the guilt of it (he being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſeperated from the filth, and defilement of it in his Conception, by the power of the holy Ghoſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called, <hi>That holy thing conceived</hi> in the Virgin. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35.) And ſo the Curſe and puniſhment due to us. This Chriſt was the Son and Heir of Man in. For <hi>God made him, that knew no ſin to be ſin for us, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>And he Redeemed us from the Curſe of the law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi> Gal. 3.13. And therefore was <hi>made under the Law;</hi> obnoxious to all our debts, forfeitures, and penalties, <hi>That he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from under the law: that we by him</hi> (receiving and believing in him) <hi>might receive the Adoption of Children:</hi> even of the Children of God; and ſo being <hi>Sons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Heirs</hi> of God, in, and through him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 17. So that this was for our great advantage: alſo; he hereby becoming <hi>the Son</hi> (the moſt excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming, infranchiſing, inriching <hi>Son) of Man,</hi> upon whom, all the hope, and help of Man lyeth.

We find, that in former times, the Angels appeared in the likeneſs of Men (yea, Chriſt himſelf might, and doubtleſs did, ſometimes as to his Spiritual Being ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear alſo, before he was Incarnate, and made of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.13, 14, 15.)

or holy men if he pleaſeth, as Angels to Men, to bring his meſſages to them (the name of Angel, being not a name of Nature, but of Office; ſignifying a Meſſenger: a Title that may agree to any natural imploy'd, and ſent of God on his meſſuages, as the Angels of the Seven Churches. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20.)

Grace, and love worthy to be minded, and remembred always by us, for in that, he is very Man, <hi>the Son of Man</hi> therein is manifeſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods great love, and condeſcention to us, in giving us the moſt excellent advantage of knowing him, and his will concerning us, in a more full, ſatisfying, and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar way, then by any other, or former diſpenſation, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing himſelf to us. God in former times, by ſundry ways, and in diverſe manners, ſpake to the Fathers by the Prophets, to whom he made known himſelf, by Dreams, Viſions, Angels, and ſuch like appearances. And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, by a more viſible Demonſtration of his preſence, and audible ſpeaking of his voice to them, out of the midſt of the Fire, when he gave the Law upon <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:53764:30"/>

But as for thoſe ways of making himſelf, and his will known, they were more low and mediate, then now in his ſpeaking to us, by his own, and only begotten Son. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2, 3. Indeed, that of his giving the Law on <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> was accompanied with moſt certain, and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed evidences, of its being the voice and diſpenſation of God; ſuch as never was vouchſafed to any people beſide, or to them, at any other time. But that was with ſo much terrour and dreadfulneſs, that the people were not able to hear, or to bear it. Yea, <hi>Moſes himſelf,</hi> its ſaid, <hi>did exceedingly fear and quake.</hi> Heb. 12.18, 20, 21. And all the people, when they heard the voice of the Words, with the ſound of the Trumphet, and terrible Thundrings, accompaning Gods ſo ſpeaking to them, and ſaw the Lightnings, the Fire, and the Mountain burning, or ſmoaking, ſhaking, and trembling under him, fled a far off; deſiring of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they might no more hear God ſpeaking after that manner to them: but that he would go near to God, and hear his Commandements, and bring it to them, and they would hear it, and do it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.18, 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29, 30. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſay they, <hi>Our God hath ſhewed us his Glory, and greatneſs; and we have heard his voice out of the midſt of the fire, we have ſeen to day that God ſpeaketh with man, and he doth live; but now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould we die? for that great fire will conſume us, if we ſhould go on to hear the voice of our God, we ſhould ſurely dye: for is there any fleſh that hath heard the voice of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, ſpeaking out of the midſt of the fire, as we have done, and yet doth live?

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53764:30"/>
Which ſaying of the people God approved of, ſaying, <hi>They have well ſpoken all that they have ſaid. A Prophet will I raiſe up to them out of their brethren like unto thee, and I will put my words into his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak to them whatſoever I command him.</hi> Deut. 18.16, 17, 18. <hi>But there aroſe no Prophet like to</hi> Moſes <hi>in Iſrael.</hi> Saith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10. Therefore God fulfilled their deſire, and his own Promiſe, in his making his own Son, to be the <hi>Son of Man.</hi> The Word by which all things were made to be made Fleſh; and in ſpeaking forth his mind &amp; will, yea himſelf to Mankind by him; for herein we have God ſpeaking to us, &amp; yet a Prophet raiſed up for us out of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by whom he ſpeaks. <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.22. Such a Prophet of God, as is God himſelf. God ſpeaking in, and by a man, a Son of Man: yea, ſuch a Son of man, as is ſtill God. The ſame that was in the begining with God: yet ſo covered, and hid under the veil of the Fleſh, or Manhood, that his voice terifies not from hearing it. Men might draw nigh to him, hear and ſpeak to him, converſe with him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtruction from him, and thereby be drawn to God, to love and believe on him. Surely, this is a very great grace and favour of God a marvailous condeſcention of the Divine Majeſty to us, in which, alſo he hath done for us; as <hi>Job</hi> ſometimes deſired of God for himſelf, And as <hi>Elihu</hi> anſwered him, to that deſire: we find, that <hi>Job</hi> in his great Affliction and ſore Temptations, had a great deſire to ſpeak to, and argue with God; only <hi>Two things would he deſire</hi> of him, by way of caution. <hi>viz.</hi> That he <hi>would remove his hand,</hi> (his Blow, Rod, or ſtroke of Affliction) <hi>from him, and that his Terrour might not make him afraid.</hi> Job. 9.34, 35. &amp; 13.20, 21, 22. And then ſaith he, <hi>I will ſpeak and not be afraid of him.</hi> Or as it is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>Call then and I will anſwer thee, or I will
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53764:31"/>
ſpeak, and let him anſwer me.</hi> He was ſenſible, that his hand was too heavy for him to bear: and he judged, that he was able by his preſence to affright him, and fill him with terrours; but might he be but freed from thoſe Two things, <hi>the weight of his Hand, or ſmart of his Rod; And the terrour of his Voice, through the appearance of his greatneſs and Majeſty therein.</hi> Then an intercourſe with him might be very advantageous. <hi>Elihu</hi> (whoſe Name by Interpretation is, <hi>He is my God.</hi>) Anſwers him, <hi>Cap.</hi> 33.6, 7. <hi>Behold, I am according to thy Word, inſtead of God. I am alſo formed out of the Clay. Behold, my terrour ſhall not make thee afraid, neither ſhall my hand be heavy upon thee.</hi> This is moſt exactly granted to us in Jeſus Chriſt, in his becoming <hi>the Son of Man.</hi> A real, very Man for us. One who was the Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was formed out of the Clay, and yet was inſtead af God: ſo as that, He was, and is God. And it was the Father that ſpake in, and by him; and wrought the works that he wrought. <hi>John</hi> 14.8, 9, 16, 11. There we have God ſpeaking and making known himſelf, and his mind to us; and yet, ſo as he neither laid his hand upon us to make us feel the weight of it. Nor his Rod, to beat us for our faults. But his Rod and Hand was upon him for us, <hi>That through his ſtripes he might</hi> paſs by us <hi>and heal us.</hi> Nor was his appearance dreadful, but ſuch, and with ſuch humility, lowlineſs, and meekneſs, as that all, or any might have acceſs to, and intercourſe with him, <hi>being found in the likeneſs of Men;</hi> even of ordinary men, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing differing in appearance from them, except in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs, as being without ſin. Yea, not in the likeneſs of great men, or of the Princes of this World; but only of mean men, in the <hi>form of a Servant.</hi> Such as any mean and poor men, as well, and as freely as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53764:31"/>
and richer, might have the boldneſs and liberty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. And ſo we find whole multitudes thronging to, and about him, to hear him, and ſee his Miracles: not running through fear from him, as they did at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> but preſſing upon him to hear, and ſee him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.4. &amp; 12.1. <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.33. &amp; 2.1, 2, 4. Yea, the poor, the halt, the maimed, and the moſt miſerable Creatures, had free liberty and incouragement to repair to him, to hear, and ſee him, and be helped by him. And by him, God converſed with Men, and gave forth a more clear diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, demonſtration, and knowledge of himſelf, and of his will, and mind concerning Men, then formerly; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ways, as to inſtance.</p>

And this was one of his great buſineſſes in the World, to teach the People the knowledge of God, and of his Kingdom, and of the way thereto. So we find him, Preaching, and Teaching the Word of God in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and in the <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Ships;</hi> and whereſoever the people reſorted to him; taking all occaſions thereto. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.17, 23. &amp; 5.1, 2. &amp; 13.1, 3, 4. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.14, 15, 21, 38, 39. &amp; 2.2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.58. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.37, 38. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.20.

               <p n="2">2.

So as God, even the inviſible God might be ſeen in him, as in his proper and moſt perfect Image. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. Thence it is ſaid by our Saviour, <hi>He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that ſent me; and he that ſeeth me, ſeeth him that ſent me.</hi> Joh. 12.44.45. And when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Lord ſhew us the Father, and it ſufficeth.</hi> Jeſus reproving and inſtructing him, made this anſwer, <hi>Haſt thou been ſo long time with me</hi> Philip, <hi>and haſt thou not known me? he that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father; and how ſayſt thou, ſhew us the Father?</hi> Joh. 14.8, 9. Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to us, that the inviſible God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was ſo made manifeſt in him, that in perceiving, and beholding his power, wiſdom, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, love, holineſs, meekneſs, patience, wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſame Attributes of God, might be diſcerned and known, and ſo it might in him be ſeen; how able, and wiſe, and willing God is to help, ſave, and ſuccour his poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; to forgive their ſins, to heal their diſeaſes, to ſuccour them in their needs, inſtruct their ignorances, comfort them in their diſeaſes. How loving, and good he is to all, and yet, how he hates their ſins and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And how eſpecially, good and loving to the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly virtuous; ſuch as are ſubject to, and followers of

him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that here God afforded to man a ſight of himſelf, and of his excellencies in the Son of Man, and in his demeanours, and carriages, doings, and ſufferings; that we might know him, love him, believe in him, obey and follow him, and be ſaved by him, and ſatisfied in, and with him. How great a benefit was this to the World, to have God ſo repreſented, and made manifeſt to them? and eſpecially, to ſuch in it; as cloſed with, and followed him out of their falſe Principles and ways, learning of, and obeying him: who <hi>ſaw his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father.</hi> John 1.14. So as it might in him be verified, what is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.25. <hi>They have ſeen thy goings O God, the goings of my God, my King</hi> (That is Chriſt) <hi>in holineſs,</hi> or in the holy Place or Sanctuary. Again,</p>
               <p n="3">3. By his walking as man, towards God and Man. He hath by his example, not only ſhewed us, what God is, and how he walks toward and among men; but alſo, how men ought to walk, and pleaſe God in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaners of themſelves towards God and men: for, as he was man, the Son of man, walking in God, he hath given us a perfect pattern and example, of what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of, and likes in us men. As it is ſaid, <hi>He hath left us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. And as himſelf ſaid, <hi>I have given you an example</hi> (or pattern) <hi>that as I have done to you, ſo ye ſhould do.</hi> John 13.15. And ſo he hath ſhewed us in himſelf, how we ſhould obey the call and command of God his Father, to us. How we ſhould perfectly love and truſt in God, and commit our ſelves, and our ways to him; doing all things commanded by him, without murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and without diſputing. How we ſhould patiently and quietly ſubmit our ſelves to him in all tryals, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53764:33"/>
and ſufferings that he orders to us: perfectly caſting our ſelves upon him therein, and truſting to him for his ſupport and ſeaſonable deliverance. And ſo therein he hath ſhewed us a perfect pattern of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Patience. And ſo for walking towards men, he hath ſet us an example of perfect Charity, ſeeking the good of all, and doing hurt to, or ſeeking or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the harm of none: and yet how, when we ſeek to do them good, we ſhould not have fellowſhip with them in their ſins; but in meekneſs reprove them, and where need is, uſe ſharpneſs therein: that is, where men are guileful and Hypocritical, proud and conceited, and there-through ſet themſelves againſt Gods glory, and the good of others, under pretence of Religion and Piety towards him. And ſuch were the Scribes, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, Lawyers, and the like; ſo ſmartly reproved by our Lord. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. &amp; 13.14, 15. So Chriſt alſo hath ſet forth himſelf as an example of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Magiſtrates, and of paying wrongfully, and to our own damage, what they demand of us, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then give offence by contending with them, and ſtriving againſt them therein. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.24, 25, 26, 27. As alſo, of patient putting up, and ſuffering injuries from them or others. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23. And ſo of all Righteouſneſs and goodneſs, and of all tender care of, and love to ſuch as are good, or deſire ſo to be; and to that purpoſe yeild themſelves willing and ready to learn, that they may know, and obey the truth. <hi>John</hi> 15.9, 10. &amp; 10.15. &amp; 13.34. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>he that ſaith, he abides in him, ought even ſo to walk, as he hath walked.</hi> John. 2.6. And ſurely this in every branch of it was a very great grace, or gracious condeſcention of God to us men, that he in the perſon of the Word ſhould be made
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53764:33"/>
Fleſh, and therein give us an evidence of himſelf, his name, nature, and will concerning us, both by his vocal Doctrine and Miniſtry; and by his own demeanour and walking in the Fleſh; both ſhewing us the way of Gods walking towards man; and the way how man ought to walk towards both God and Men. But again,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his being the Son of Man; that is, very man: he hath given us the greater ground of boldneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in our dependance on him, and approach to God by him, as the Mediator of God and Man, and the high Prieſt and Apoſtle of our profeſſiion, in that thereby he hath both contracted an affinity and kindred to us (as is partly ſaid afore) and hath had experience of what is in man; even of the weakneſs and frailty of the nature of man; and what temptations, oppoſitions, and evils from Men, and Devils they are expoſed to, and meet with that walk with God, and by Word, and Converſation, witneſs againſt the wickedneſs of men; and warr againſt the lies and deceipts of <hi>Sathan.</hi> As alſo he hath had an experimental knowledge, of the weakneſs of the nature of man, to ſtand under, and bear the Wrath of God; the hidings of his face from, or ſtrokes of his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Inaſmuch as he being made man, the Son of man, hath proved the frailties of man; and as a good man, obeying his Father, hath grappled with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions of ſinners, and the rage and malice of evil man, and Devils: and as bearing our ſins in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the Tree, hath felt in his humanity, the force and power of the Wrath of God. And ſo alſo hath had tryal of poverty, reproaches, hunger, thirſt, wearineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Through which, he is the meeter to be the high Prieſt over the houſe of God, and the mediator for us. This the Apoſtle mentions. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to his Brethren, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53764:34"/>
he might be a merciful, and a faithful high Prieſt in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For in that he ſuffered being tempted. He is able al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</hi> And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14, 5. As the greatneſs of his Perſon in being <hi>the Son of God, and gone into the Heavens:</hi> So alſo the reality of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and therein the experience he had of our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is made an incouragement to a bold and confident ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to him, and ſo to God for his mercy and grace, to be extended to us for our ſeaſonable help: for ſo thoſe words imploy, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>Let us hold faſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Faith, for we have not an high Prieſt, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities: but was in all points tempted like to us, without ſin.</hi> (And that was alſo for our great advantage, that he ſinned not under any temptation, for he thereby is the more pure and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the holy and pure God, in all his actings for us with him.) <hi>Let us therefore go boldly, &amp;c.</hi> Were there any ſort of men of any Profeſſion or occupation, that ſtood in need to Petition the King in any thing of concernment for their welfare, or for removing any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment thereto, redreſſing any grievance or the like: of what great advantage would it be to them, to have a friend that is ſet up purpoſely by the King, to ſeek their welfare; ſo gracious with the King, as that there is none like him, with him: his ear, and eye, and heart and hand, all at his diſpoſe as it were. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon one advanced from among the men of that Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and occupation; and one that himſelf had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, before ſuch his advancement, tryed, and exerciſed with the very ſame grievances that they now groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſeek redreſs in! Surely, in ſuch a caſe, though they might have no incouragement to hope of ſucceſs upon their own account, as being ignorant how to draw
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53764:34"/>
their Petition, and how to preſent it in ſuch manner, as might be becoming the perſon and preſence of one ſo Mighty; having been alſo rebels againſt him: yet, in the confidence of their friends intereſt in him, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs to them, how might they be aſſured of ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in putting up their Petition by his hand, and as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, formed, and tendred by him? Such our caſe. Our Lord Jeſus that came on purpoſe <hi>into the World to ſave ſinners,</hi> and is gone up to the Father to be our friend with him. <hi>A Prince and Saviour ever living,</hi> as the great high Prieſt, <hi>to make interceſſion for them that come to God by him,</hi> is, <hi>one of us,</hi> as it were, a real man, and our kinſman, and hath been tryed with our infirmities, temptations, and grievances, and ſo <hi>knows our mold and temper,</hi> as to the weakneſs and frailty of it, by his own proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. And how alſo may that give incouragement to hope for mercy and help from him, as in mediating with God for us, ſo in ordering the government of God, as the great Prince and Lord over us, ſo as not to lay upon us more then we can bear; much leſs, more then is equal and right? He being alſo ſuch a lover of us, as is manifeſt in the next conſideration. Namely that,</p>
               <p n="3">3. He therefore became <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> and ſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al very man, that he might be in a capacity to ſuffer, and offer for us, what was needful and behooveful for our Redemption from ſin and death; and for obtaining for us Gods favour and bleſſing. It was his great buſineſs in coming into the World to ſave ſinners. And to that purpoſe, to take away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. Now in all Sacrifices for Sin, there was the ſuffering of the Sacrifice to Death; that being given, and taken in exchange for the Sinner, who ought to have ſuffered elſe for his own ſin: and then there was the offering of it up unto God on the Altar
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53764:35"/>
as a gift, as it were, to him. Now, then Chriſt being come into the World to take, or purge away our ſin by Sacrifice, was firſt to bear our ſin on himſelf, even the puniſhment of it, and ſo ſuffer for it, as to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, and make amends to the Law, that ſin had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated; that ſo God might with equity and juſtice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe the puniſhment, and forgive the ſinner; and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the intereſt, right, and title of him that had <hi>the power of Death, that is the Devil,</hi> to urge for, or be an arbitrary inflicter of puniſhment upon us, according to his will. Chriſt, as in the form of God; and as God could not ſuffer the weight of our ſin and puniſhment unto Death. Therefore it was behooveful, that he ſhould be made in a nature capable of ſuffering: And what ſhould that be for us men, but the nature of man, even the ſame that ſinned? And ſo it's ſaid in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch, as the Children were partakers of fleſh and blood. He himſelf alſo took part of the ſame, that by Death he might deſtroy him who had the power of Death, that is, the Devil.</hi> As implying, that he could not have deſtroyed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; that is, made null his Power and Juriſdiction over us, but by death. Nor could he have died to that end, if he had not been partaker of fleſh, and blood with us; and therefore he took part with us, in fleſh and blood; that is, was <hi>made of a Woman and under the Law, in the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of ſinful fleſh. The Son of Man,</hi> That he might be capable of ſuffering ſuch things as Death and Curſe for us, to redeem and deliver us from death, and curſe, and from the fear of them. And to the ſame purpoſe he ſpeaks of his offering, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.3. With 10.5, 6, 10. <hi>Every high Prieſt is appointed to offer gifts and ſacrifices: wherefore alſo it was neceſſary, that this man ſhould have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to offer.</hi> And what that was, is ſaid. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.5, 6, 10. Namely, the <hi>body</hi> that <hi>God prepared for him;</hi> the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53764:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
body of his fleſh that died. This through the eternal Spirit, being raiſed from the dead, he offered up unto God for us, as an <hi>offering of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto him.</hi> In which God finding reſt, and well-pleaſedneſs; through him he is gracious and propitious to us. Upon this account therefore, and upon this mainly; it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that Chriſt ſhould be the Son of man, very man for us. For as <hi>Adam</hi> was ſomething before he was a man; namely, duſt and clay, ſomething below the nature of man, and therefore in that form incapable of knowing, and praiſing God, till being made into a man, indued with a reaſonable and underſtanding Soul, he was made capable: ſo even ſo Chriſt alſo was ſomething before he was a man, ſomething higher and better then earthly man, even the Lord in heaven, and therefore not capable, as being in the form of God of dying, and ſo of being an offering and ſacrifice for man, ſo as in the Nature of man he was: and this is that, wherein the greatneſs of Gods grace was teſtified toward us, in making his only begotten Son the propitiation or propitiatory Sacrifice for our ſins, to prepare him a body for us, and to lay the iniquities of us all upon him therein. And this is the foundation and bottom, as well as alſo the great and main matter of his declaration to us, of what concerns us to know; and the foundation and ground of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing for us, with his Father as Mediator of God and Man, and the great high-Prieſt over his houſe; and his being Man, (<hi>the Son of Man.</hi> Verily man,) fitted him for this, both as thereby he had what to ſuffer in, and what to offer: as alſo, I might adde, as therein he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came our Brother and Kinſman, as is ſaid before: and ſo according to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Levit. 25.48, 49. The The right of redeeming us, appertained to him. For the man that hath ſold himſelf for a ſervant, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53764:36"/>
by one of kin to him, as is there ſaid. And that he might hint to us all this grace of God, in theſe forementioned branches we may underſtand him, ſtiling himſelf <hi>the Son of Man.</hi> That's the Fourth.</p>

Laſtly, he ſtiles himſelf <hi>the Son of Man;</hi> (or, as ſome read it, <hi>That Son of Man</hi>) with reference to that Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> that went before of him, in which he was repreſented in ſuch an appearance, and ſo declared: that he might ſignifie, that he is <hi>that Son of Man</hi> of whom the ſaid Prophet wrote, and ſpoke in his ſaid Viſion. And ſo to ſhew himſelf to be what is therein ſignified; which, what it was may be perceived by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the place. It is in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. Where God ſhewed to <hi>Daniel</hi> the things that were to come to paſs in the World. The Kingdoms that ſhould be ſet up and take place therein. And ſo he ſaw firſt <hi>four great Beaſts</hi> ariſe up out of the Sea, which the Angel afterwards tells him ſhould be <hi>four Kings;</hi> that is, ſucceſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now thoſe four Beaſts, Kings, or Kingdoms, were the four Kingdoms or Empires of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> that ſhould with their Kings and Emperours have the great command of the Earth; and they are repreſented like Beaſts there (or as the word properly ſignifies, Wild, or Savage Beaſts; as the Lyon, Bear, Leopard, and the fourth, a compoſure of them all. <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. With <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2.) To ſignifie, and imply, the Savageneſs, Brutiſhneſs, and unreaſonableneſs of thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments: That they ſhould rule by Might, Will, and Power, more then by (yea with a neglect and contempt of) right, reaſon, and equity, as indeed they have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally done. But then in <hi>ver.</hi> 13. There is a Viſion of one ſaid to <hi>be like the Son of man coming in the clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, brought near to the ancient of days; to whom was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53764:36"/>
dominion and glory. And a Kingdom, that all Nations, Peoples and Languages ſhould obey and ſerve him</hi> Now this is afterward interpreted to be the <hi>Kingdom of the Saints,</hi> or <hi>of the People of the Saints of the moſt high God.</hi> ver. 26, 27. In which, Chriſt ſhall be the great King and Governour; and he therefore is principally and properly denoted by that one like to the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> to whom was given the Dominion, Glory, and Kingdom, as was before expreſſed. But by the oppoſition of this mention of his appearance, to the mention of the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and reſemblance of the other Kings and Kingdoms is denoted doubtleſs: not only, that he ſhould be a real Man, as to the verity of his human nature, to whom the Kingdom ſhould be given: But alſo, that he ſhould be as <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> as to his Government, and ordering of the Kingdom, in diſtinction from, or oppoſition to thoſe that would be, and Govern like Savage and Ravenous Beaſts. Namely, that he ſhould Govern, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be governed, or ordered, by right, reaſon, equity, mildneſs, gentleneſs, and diſcretion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which things belong to man as made of God, and in diſtinction from the Bruit and Savage Beaſts. And ſo that <hi>He ſhould reign in righteouſneſs, and his Princes</hi> (the Saints reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him) ſhould <hi>decree Juſtice</hi> and govern with Law and equity. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.1, 2. Now our Saviour in calling himſelf the, or that <hi>Son of Man.</hi> May, (and as I apprehend did) therein imply, and ſignifie, that he was that perſon ſpoken of in that Viſion and Prophecy; to whom the Kingdom and Glory, and Dominion was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and ſhould be given of God. To whom, all Peoples, Nations, and Languages owe obedience and ſervice. And who ſhould and will Judge the Nations of the Earth (both as to that Judgment exerciſed in his Word and Providences, and by his Spirit now: And as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53764:37"/>
to his ordering the Government of God, judging, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, and reigning at the laſt, in his glorious Kingdom with his Saints) in equity and righteouſneſs, according to the rules of that reaſon that is ſound indeed: even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word and mind of God. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is alſo, that our Saviour ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 5.22, 23, 26. <hi>That the Father Judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgment</hi> (or Government) <hi>to the Son, that all men might honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that ſent him. And he hath given him power to execute Judgment alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the Son of man;</hi> even <hi>the</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Son of Man; who in the night Viſions were ſeen to be brought nigh to the ancient of days; to whom the Dominion, Glory, and Kingdom was given. And that phraſe <hi>[becauſe he is the Son of Man]</hi> in this view of it implies alſo becauſe of his equity, reaſonableneſs, ſound judgment, wiſdom, and diſcretion, with freedom from all bruitiſh ignorance, ſelf-will, unrighteouſneſs, cruelty, unreaſonableneſs, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and ſuch other paſſions and diſ-affections as too commonly blind other Governours, or perſons that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Authority.</p>
               <p>Such may be the reaſons of Chriſts being ſtiled, or ſtiling himſelf <hi>the Son of Man.</hi> Every of them worthy to be duly conſidered by us, and rightly improved for moving us to love, and thankfulneſs to God. High-prizings, and ready receit of, cloſing and complying with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in his addreſſes to us; his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious calls to, and counſels of us: turning at his reproofs, obeying his commands, and ſubmitting to his rule and Government in all things.

And in this ſenſe, to lift up, is to take away, more properly by ſuch a death, as in which the body is lifted up from the Earth, as to be hanged on a Tree. And ſo its applyed alſo to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, with reſpect to his death, and the manner of it: as the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo underſtood him. <hi>John</hi> 12. For having ſaid. And, <hi>I if I be lifted up, will draw all men to me.</hi> It is added, this <hi>ſpake he, as ſignifying what manner of death he ſhould dye.</hi> As implying, That the Phraſe of lifting up, had reſpect to his Death; and that the <hi>Jews</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, of a way of dying is apparent in the next verſe,

where it follows, <hi>The people anſwered him, we have heard out of the Law, that Chriſt abideth for ever: how ſayſt thou then, the Son of Man muſt be lifted up! who is this Son of Man?</hi> Plainly implying, that they underſtood his words (after an uſe of it in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Language, then frequently or uſually ſpoken by them) to import, a taking him away by death.

                  </gap>, in the verſe before [<hi>that this he ſpake ſignifying what</hi> (or what manner of) <hi>death he ſhould dye</hi>] may plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in it, his being hanged on a Tree (as <hi>Pharoahs</hi> chief Butler was) in a ſort. And as Chriſt is ſaid to have been, in his being Crucified. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.30. <hi>The God of our Fathers raiſed up Jeſus whom ye ſlew, and hanged on a tree.</hi> And the ſame expreſſion is uſed by the ſame Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi> Act. 10.39. And by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in <hi>Acts.</hi> 13.29. in ſaying, <hi>They took him down from the tree.</hi> And more plainly in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. In ſaying, <hi>Chriſt hath Redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us. As it is written, Curſed is every one that is hanged on a tree.</hi> Where the ſame way of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, that is called by <hi>Moſes,</hi> a hanging on the tree; is applied to Chriſts being Crucified. Though yet poſſibly there may be more in that expreſſion <hi>[ſignifying what manner of death he ſhould dye] Viz.</hi> That he ſhould dye as a Sacrifice, as a publick propitiatory Sacrifice for us, a ranſome for all. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. And in this ſenſe Chriſt was lifted up by men; they lifted him up from the Earth, ſo as to take away his life from off the Earth, or to cut him <hi>off from the Land of the living.</hi> As the phraſe is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53 8. And ſo it was fore-ſaid by our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 8.28. <hi>When ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then ſhall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Where it is evident, that he was to be lifted up in this ſenſe by the <hi>Jews.</hi> For it was the <hi>Jews (The hands
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53764:38"/>
of wicked men that ſlew him, and hanged him on the tree)</hi> that lifted him up in this ſenſe. And in that ſenſe it behoved him to be lifted up even by men, that all things written of him might be fulfilled. As it is ſaid, <hi>When they had fulfilled all things written of him, they took him down from the Tree.</hi> That is, When they had put him to death, the death of the Croſs, ſlain him, and hanged him on the tree, with all the ſpite and violence againſt him they uſed in reviling him, giving him Vineger to drink part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Garments, and caſting lots on his Veſture, piercing him with a Spear in his ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for all theſe things were fore-propheſied of him) <hi>They took him down, &amp;c.</hi> Implying, that their ſo ſlaying him, and putting him to death, their hanging him on a tree, was written of before, and therefore was to be fulfilled; for <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be broken;</hi> as is ſaid by himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 10.35. That is, They muſt be fulfilled: as he alſo implyed in his ſaying to <hi>Peter, Thinkeſt thou not, that I could pray the Father, and he would ſend me more then twelve Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? But how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be?</hi> Mat. 26.54. &amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 56. <hi>All this was done, that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.</hi> See alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.35. With <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.16. &amp; 69.21. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. With <hi>John</hi> 19.34.37. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he muſt and ought thus to have been lifted up, that the purpoſe of God might be accompliſhed: For they did herein <hi>whatſoever his hand and his counſel had before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be done.</hi> As is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. &amp; 4.27.28. That ſo we might <hi>be redeemed from the curſe of the Law</hi> by his <hi>being made a Curſe for us,</hi> as is ſaid <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. Now ſeeing he was thus lifted up, and there was ſuch a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for it too, this ſenſe of his being lifted up muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily (if not moſt directly) be here included. And to the uſe of the word <hi>lifting up</hi> in this ſenſe, might be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53764:39"/>
referred the lifting up of the Talent of <hi>Lead</hi> with the <hi>Epha</hi> into which it was caſt (ſignifying wickedneſs) to be removed into the Land of <hi>Shinar.</hi> Zech. 5.6, 7. And the lifting up of the Sacrifices upon the Altar to be burnt up. But I but mention them. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To lift up</hi> ſignifies often, <hi>to exalt, magnifie, or glorifie.</hi> And to the ſame phraſe of lifting up the head, is uſed by <hi>Joſeph</hi> too, in his interpretations, in a quite contrary ſenſe to the former. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.13.20, 21. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the chief Butlers Dream, he tells him, <hi>Within three days ſhall</hi> Pharoah <hi>lift up thy head, and reſtore thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy place; and thou ſhalt deliver</hi> Pharoahs <hi>cup into his hand. And it came to paſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.) <hi>That the third day, which was</hi> Pharaohs <hi>birth day, he lifted up the head of the chief Butler, and he reſtored the chief Butler unto his chief Butlerſhip again.</hi> And ſo <hi>the lifting up the horn,</hi> was the exalting, and lifting it up on high. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.10. And according to the Spirit, the exalting or magnifying the Kingdom and Power of Chriſt and his Saints. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.5. And in this ſenſe alſo Chriſt was to be lifted up; that is, exalted: and that both by God and Men, as we may ſee. And in this ſenſe, the ſame Greek word here ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>lifted up,</hi> is often tranſlated, to <hi>exalt,</hi> or to be <hi>exalted</hi> or <hi>magnified.</hi> As in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.11. &amp; 18.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. &amp; 5.31. But in this ſenſe of <hi>lifting up,</hi> there is ſomething implyed, even that which was done, and included in the former ſenſe, or way of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted up: Namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he was, or is down, as it were; made low, and in a low place, condition, or eſteem. For as when the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had ſaid by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Thou haſt aſcended up on high.</hi> The Apoſtle from it inferrs, <hi>Now that he Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, what is it but that be firſt Deſcended into the lower parts of the earth?</hi> Pſal. 68.18. With <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 9. So
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53764:39"/>
we may ſay here, in that he ſaith, <hi>The Son of Man muſt be lifted up.</hi> What is it, but that the Son of man was below, or was down, in a mean ſtate or poſture; and in a lower place then that, to which he muſt be lifted up? And ſurely ſo he was; and in ſome ſenſe is ſo yet. As to ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of bodily place. This Son of man was (though now he is not) here upon the Earth, born here, and living, walking, acting, and converſing here. Though he was the heavenly One, the Lord in Heaven; yet, he came from Heaven, from above. As it's ſaid, <hi>He that cometh from above, or from Heaven, is above all.</hi> John 3.32. He was above, in reſpect of what he was before he was manifeſt to men. But he deſcended into the lower parts of the Earth; the lower parts of Gods Creation, the Earth. Yea, into the lower parts, <hi>the heart of the Earth.</hi> Epheſ 4.9. <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.40. And ſo it's ſaid by him. <hi>And I when I am lifted up from the Earth will draw all men to me.</hi> John 12.32. He was then on the Earth, and thence to be <hi>lifted up</hi> on the Earth in reſpect of place. And</p>
               <p n="2">2 In reſpect of State; in reſpect of what God did to him; and what he ſubmitted and yielded up himſelf to: he was in a low and humble ſtate and appearance among men in the world; being <hi>of rich</hi> made and <hi>become poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 8, 9. Of one in <hi>the form of God, not thinking it robbery to be equal with God.</hi> He was made in <hi>the form of a Servant, and was found in the faſhion and habit of a man,</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> he <hi>partook</hi> with us <hi>in Fleſh and Blood,</hi> and was made <hi>under the Law,</hi> in a Bondage and Servile ſtate. <hi>A Servant to Rulers;</hi> though he was Lord of all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.7.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53764:40"/>
and he when born was entertained there in a Manger. As alſo, by the offering of his Virgin Mother, offering, according to the appointment of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> for poor people, whoſe hand or ſufficiency could not reach to the offering a Lamb. Viz. <hi>A pair of Pigeons, or two Turtle Doves.</hi> Luk. 2.7, 24. With <hi>Levit.</hi> 12, 8. As alſo in that his reputed Father, to whom the Virgin his Mother was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed, was not a perſon of any great port in the World, or in any office or dignity; but a <hi>Carpenter,</hi> as he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.53. Yea, and it appears, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſometimes wrought of that Trade; being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called by way of reproach <hi>the Carpenter.</hi> Mark. 6.3. And when he manifeſted himſelf to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he was not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any great followers: but his Diſciples were noted to be illiterate and mean men, <hi>Fiſhers, Tole-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and the like.

Being therein num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with Tranſgreſſors: yea, and being dead, he was taken down and laid in the Earth, in the heart of the earth, (as we noted before) <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Making his Grave with the rich, and with the wicked in his death.</hi> Iſa. 53.9.

Whence they judged him, <hi>ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted.</hi> Though indeed, <hi>He was wounded and tormented for our tranſgreſſions, bruiſed for our iniquities; the chaſtiſement of our peace fell upon him, and through his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> Iſa. 53.4, 5.

What is ſaid, evidences his being low, ſometimes both in himſelf, and in mens eſteem of him; and too low in this latter reſpect; too generally yet, and that's one thing implied in this phraſe, <hi>That he muſt be lifted up.</hi> But yet further,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he is the ſubject of this lifting, or to be lifted, up, as he is the Son of Man; Not as he is the Son of God ſimply conſidered: though he be alſo the Son of God. It is the ſame perſon, that is both the Son of Man, and the Son of God, in different reſpects. Yea, the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God; yet our Saviour ſaith not, the Son of God muſt be lifted up, but the Son of Man; and good reaſon for it: for it was not as the Son of God, ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53764:42"/>
that he was low; for therein the Nature of Man was exalted, in being made the Son of God: and that alſo was one act of his exaltation, as the Son of Man or ſeed of <hi>David.</hi> He, as the Son of God abiding, only, as the Son of God, without Being, made the Son of Man, had not therein been low or abaſed, but had a bid in his proper height, uncapable of higher exaltation in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but it was the Son of God, become the Son of Man, that was abaſed and low, and therefore as the Son of Man (though alſo the Son of God, in that form or ſtate) that was to be exalted or lifted up. Which is worthy to be noted, againſt thoſe who make the humanity of Chriſt to be but a diſpenſation made uſe of for a time; that is, till the Spirit was ſent forth to be the Comforter: and then as <hi>Moſes</hi> and his miniſtration paſſed away to give place to Chriſt and his Miniſtration, when he came in the fleſh: So Chriſt his fleſh, or his being in it, was to paſs away and ceaſe. And mens minding his fleſh humanity, or diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation therein to paſs away, in the coming of the Spirit. Indeed, his appearing in the fleſh, to Miniſter in it, and as a man, by perſonal acting, preaching, and working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles viſibly among men was to ceaſe, not at the coming of the Spirit, but before it, and to make way for it, to be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth upon the Diſciples; that they in, and by it, might be inabled and ſtrengthned to miniſter in his ſtead. But his Fleſh or Body, neither ceaſed to be in him, nor to be uſeful to, and for us, and needful to be known, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and conſidered by us, even after the Spirit, was ſent forth upon the Apoſtles; for the Spirit when he came, witneſſed of him who was in the Fleſh; and confeſſed him (not come in the Spirit but) come in the Fleſh. Saith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2. And <hi>every Spirit that confeſſeth not Chriſt come in the fleſh,</hi> but lays him aſide in that conſideration, as no more needful to be eyed or known (and ſo that ſpeaks of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53764:43"/>
him, as gone out of the fleſh; except they thereby only mean, out of his frail infirm ſtate) <hi>is not of God: but is that Spirit of Antichriſt that was to come into the World; and now is in the World.</hi> ver. 3. It is the Son of Man, which the Spirit cannot be ſaid to be, <hi>that is, to be lifted up.</hi> Let that be minded by us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I might alſo note, that in ſaying the <hi>Son of Man muſt be lifted up,</hi> there is implied ſome agent to lift him up; for where there is a ſubject to be wrought upon, there is alſo in what is wrought upon, or about it; ſomething that acts, or works; as when any thing is heated, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heats it. When any thing is beaten, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or perſon beats it. So, when any thing is exalted, or <hi>lifted up,</hi> there is ſome thing, or perſon exalts it. As <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs: ſo there is ſome body, ſome perſons, or perſon that muſt lift up the <hi>Son of Man;</hi> which we ſhall inquire into, and conſider who, or what it is in our ſpeaking further to the act it ſelf, of <hi>lifting him up.</hi> Which we come now to conſider, more fully; as taken in the ſecond ſenſe of that expreſſion, as the <hi>lifting up</hi> ſignifies, to Exalt, or Magnifie.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p> A Twofold way of Exalting the Son of Man; either by real Action upon his perſon, namely: Or by demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, and his worth and excellency to others. The former of theſe is here inlarged upon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOW Chriſt the Son of Man, may be capable of lifting up, or being exalted, two ways, ſuitable to the twofold way of his being low: that is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to real and Perſonal Exaltation, by ſomething acted upon himſelf. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to Demonſtration and Manifeſtation of him to others, for exalting him in their views, and eſteems. Let us conſider theſe Two ways diſtinctly. And ſo, 1.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the former; He was exalted and lifted up of God, even the Father. He exalted, lifted up, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified him, as was behoveful and needful for us; in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Acts. As to ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his taking the Humanity, or Seed of <hi>David, Abraham,</hi> and ſo of the Woman. The Son of Man into unity of Perſon, with his Eternal Word, or only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son. As was hinted by the way before. And this was a great favour to, and exaltation of that Seed. As it is ſaid, <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty. I have Exalted one choſen out of the People,</hi> Pſal. 89.19. And <hi>that holy thing that ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> Luk. 1.35. Though indeed this was rather a lifting up that Nature, then that Perſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his calling him forth, to ſuffer for us; or rather, his accepting him, and his ſufferings for us, as a valuable price of our Redemption, a ſatisfaction to his Juſtice,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53764:44"/>
and Sacrifice, or Atonement for our ſins. And ſo our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf may be underſtood to ſay, when ſpeaking of the hour of his ſufferings; he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 12.23. <hi>The hour is come, that the Son of Man ſhould be glorified.</hi> And when <hi>Judas</hi> was gone out to betray him into the hands of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; he ſaid, <hi>Now is the Son of Man glorified; and God is glorified in him.</hi> John 13.31. And with that agrees the Apoſtle, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. Where he ſaith, That <hi>Jeſus was Crowned with glory and honour, for the ſuffering of Death: that he by the Grace of God might caſt Death for every man.</hi> Not only that he was glorified through ſufferings, but that he might taſte Death. And indeed, as the other, ſo this alſo was a great glory and honour (though a great abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, and ſuffering in himſelf, as he was the Son of God) that the Father ſhould account and value him at ſo high and great a rate, as to judge him, this Son of Man, of ſufficient value to anſwer for, and expiate the ſins of the World. Whereas, all other Sacrifices (though <hi>all the Beaſts of Lebanon</hi>) could not be <hi>ſufficient for a burnt ſacrifice:</hi> nor all the Wood in that mighty Foreſt ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to burn, to kindle that fire, that ſhould conſume that, that ſhould be pleaſing to him for any mans ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.16. Not <hi>thouſands of Rams, nor ten thouſand rivers of Oyl, no nor the fruit of the body, even the firſt-born, for the ſin of the Soul.</hi> Mic. 6.7. No nor the richeſt, wealthieſt man in the world, how ever full of riches, or high and mighty, could by all his riches (though he offer them all, or lay them all out in Sacrifices, to be offered up to God, for any one man though his deareſt brother) could make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of his ſins, ſo as to <hi>give</hi> thereby <hi>a ſufficient price to God for him, that he might live for ever, and not ſee Corruption.</hi> So <hi>precious is the Redemption of the Soul.</hi> Pſal. 49.7, 8. Yet God hath accepted the abaſement, ſufferings, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his Son, the Son of Man; as a valuable, ſufficient
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53764:44"/>
Ranſome for all men; ſo as through him to <hi>preach remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſins,</hi> to them, and <hi>justifie all that believe on him,</hi> upon that account, <hi>from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes, and all its ſacrifices: yea, ſo as to juſtifie all from that firſt Sentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as they ſhall none of them periſh therein, but be all raiſed up again there-from. The <hi>Free gift</hi> herethrough abounding <hi>to all men, to the juſtification of life.</hi> Rom. 3.22, 23, 24. &amp; 5.18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22. This honour God put upon none elſe, Man or Angel, to call them forth to that Judgment, to ſatifie for, and redeem any man from death, and deſtruction. But he hath ſo magnified his Son, as to look upon him, as ſufficient to be the <hi>propitiation for the ſins of the whole World.</hi> If it be a magnifying a man (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith) to take pains with him, in <hi>viſiting him every morning, and trying him every moment</hi> that he might purifie, and purge him from ſin, and render him fit for fellowſhip with him, <hi>Job</hi> 7.17, 18. Surely, then it was much more a magnifying the Son of Man, and a greater account made of him, to take him as an offering and oblation, a ranſome and expiation for the ſins of the whole World; ſo as upon that account to uphold, and ſpare the whole World, during the day of his grace and patience; and to juſtifie, and ſave for ever, all that come to God, and abide with him, in, and through him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his raiſing him up from the Dead; which was an eminent Act of the exaltation and lifting up of his Perſon. <hi>A lifting him up from the gates of Death, that he might ſhew forth his praiſes in the gates of the Daughters of Sion.</hi> As is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.13. And of this raiſing him up from the Dead, may that be underſtood prophetically that is written in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.1, 2. Where this Phraſe is uſed, of lifting up. <hi>I will extol thee O Lord, for thou haſt lifted me up, and haſt not made my foes to rejoyce over me.</hi> Comparing it with <hi>ver.</hi> 3.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53764:45"/>
Where he ſaith, <hi>O Lord, thou haſt brought up my Soul from the Grave. Thou haſt kept me alive, that I ſhould not go down to the pit.</hi> Or rather (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifies, and as <hi>Symmachus</hi> reads it) thou haſt quickned me, or made me alive again, from my going down into the pit. Or as ſome read it; from them that go down into the pit: in which he alſo <hi>was mightily declared, to be the Son of God with power,</hi> Rom. 1.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moſt fully in his exalting him at his right hand, in his Aſcention, and taking him up into his own Glory: that's called an exalting, or lifting him up. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. For it's the ſame Word that is here Tranſlated, <hi>lifted up. Him hath God exalted</hi> (or lifted up) <hi>with his right hand, a Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins:</hi> This was moſt evidently and fully a glorifying of him, according to what himſelf alſo ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 13.31, 32. <hi>Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God ſhall alſo glorifie him, in himſelf; and ſhall ſtraight way glorifie him.</hi> Of this it's ſaid, <hi>God raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.21. A lifting him up indeed. For herein he <hi>was lifted up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As to place: both out of Grave and Hell, and alſo out of, and above the Earth, into the heavenly places; as in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>He raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenlies,</hi> or heavenly places; <hi>for he is not entred into the holy places, made with hands:</hi> into which the High Prieſts under the Law, uſed once a year to enter, <hi>but into Heaven it ſelf.</hi> Heb. 9.24. To which agrees, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. <hi>He is gone up into Heaven.</hi> Yea, <hi>far above all Heavens.</hi> All theſe viſible, and perceptible heavens, or what are known to us. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>far above all Heavens.</hi> As oppoſed to the Earth, from which he Aſcended and went; and where
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53764:45"/>
other high Prieſts uſed to Miniſter. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.4. Unto which Earth, he ſhall deſcend again from Heaven, when he comes again to Judge the World in righteouſneſs. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.15, 16. As he was not in the Grave, when he was riſen: So being now in Heaven; he is not upon the Earth, in reſpect of that body, and perſonal Being, in which he Aſcended, and went up to Heaven. He <hi>was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up into Heaven.</hi> So as he truly ſaid, <hi>I am no more in the World, but I come to thee.</hi> John 17.11. <hi>And I leave the World, and go to the Father.</hi> John 16.28. And, <hi>me ye have not always.</hi> Namely, preſent with you in body; in ſuch a manner, as he ſaid, <hi>The poor ye have always with you.</hi> Matt. 26.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of ſtate, He is lifted up, and exalted to dignity and honour; into a more excellent and glorious condition, then either he himſelf was in here among men: or then other, either Man, or Angel is in, A State</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of greater felicity then ever any other man, or Angel was, or is in; his Body, which was here ſubject to many infirmities and weakneſſes, in <hi>the ſimilitude of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fleſh,</hi> capable of being put to pain and ſmart, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of troubles, and injuries; yea, actually abaſed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, and made vile: is now glorified, and become glorious. <hi>A body of glory,</hi> as its called in the <hi>Greek. Phil.</hi> 3.20. And ſuch is its Glory, that in its appearance from Heaven to St <hi>Paul</hi> the glory ſhining from it, was <hi>in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, far ſurpaſſing the glory of the Sun at mid-day.

Yea, the glory of its ſhining to him, ſtruck him blind, ſo as that he could not ſee; ſo as the glory of the Sun in its greateſt brightneſs will not (at leaſt on ſuch a ſodain) at any time do. <hi>Act.</hi> 22.11: And as for his perſon, he is ſo in the preſence of God, and ſo immediately beholds his face, and is filled with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53764:46"/>
and glory, that he is in that <hi>fullneſs of joy</hi> that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and of <hi>the pleaſures that are there for evermore.</hi> The hope and aſſurance of which, exceedingly animated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him in his ſufferings, and unto them; ſo as <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Croſs, and deſpiſe the Shame;</hi> as appears, comparing <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. With <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8, 9, 10, 11. Which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> applies to Chriſt, as Prophetically fore-ſeen and ſpoken of him. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25. This excellent and moſt happy State was the Son of Man to be lifted up into; and accordingly into it he is lifted up, and exalted. Being <hi>glorified with Gods own ſelf, with the glory he had with him, before the World was.</hi> John 17.5. The Son of Man, or Chriſt in the Nature of Man, being taken, or <hi>received up into glory.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. So owned of God, as no other, either Man, or Angel.

Yea, <hi>All the fullneſs of the God-head dwells in him, bodily.</hi> Col. 2.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A State of greater Authority, Power, and Majeſty.

But yet we may not think, that it was the Prophets fore-ſeeing, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewing theſe things that was the proper cauſe of their being ordered of God to be done: no, but they therefore fore-ſaw, and fore-ſhewed them, becauſe God had order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, to be ſo done; and they were ſo ordered of God.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

               </argument>
               <p>SEcondly, he was to be lifted up (and muſt be ſo) in the demonſtration of him to men, in order to the lifting him up in their hearts, and eſteems: and that was to be, and was done.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Principally of God, both Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of God his Father, and ſo he was lifted up by him, in his bearing teſtimony to him, by commending him unto men, as his only begotten Son, peculiarly owned, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of him; and this he did diverſly, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his audibly witneſſing to him from Heaven, that he is <hi>his well-beloved Son, in whom he is well-pleaſed,</hi> and whom he would have men <hi>to hear.</hi> And this he did, both to the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> with viſible Teſtimony, alſo accompanying it; as the opening of the Heavens, and deſcent of the holy Ghoſt upon him, in a viſible appearance, like a <hi>Dove;</hi> As God, when he ſent <hi>John</hi> to Baptize, had foretold him, he ſhould ſee as a demonſtration of the Perſon of the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World. <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.17. <hi>John.</hi> 1.32, 33, 34. As alſo to the three Diſciples, who went up into the holy Mount with him, and ſee him Trans-figured before them; as is mentioned in <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.1, 5. <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.2, 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.28, 35. And by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. As alſo he did bear witneſs to him, when by an audible voice from heaven, he ſaid, <hi>He had both glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his name, and would glorifie it again.</hi> When <hi>the People</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:53764:52"/>
ſome of them <hi>ſaid that it Thundred, others, that an Angel ſpake to him.</hi> John 12.28, 29. But theſe things were known to few.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his ſpeaking and working, by him ſuch things as never any ſpake or did: for the words that he ſpake, he ſpake not from himſelf as man alone; but of or from the Father who dwelt in him; and he it was that did the Works. <hi>John</hi> 14.10. Whence he ſaith to <hi>Philip, Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me for the works ſake.</hi> ver. 11. With Chap. 15.24. &amp; 7.46. And that God did magnifie him in this, and lift him up among men. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifies. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth, a man approved of God by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Wonders, and Signes, which God did by him. &amp;c.</hi> As alſo,</p>
               <p n="3">3. By his raiſing him from the dead, glorifying him, and maintaining his cauſe and name, againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and gathering in a Church to him, and upholding it in the midſt of Perſecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of which things I ſhall not inlarge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of God, the Word, or Son alſo, even by himſelf or his Divine, Being, or Deity, exerting and putting forth it ſelf, and ſo glorifying him as the Son of Man. And ſo it behoved him, and he did it. Both</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Work. As in his working glorious Miracles. Thus its ſaid, upon his turning Water into Wine, at that Marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee. This beginning of Miracles did Jeſus in</hi> Cana <hi>of</hi> Galilee, <hi>and manifeſted forth his glory.</hi> But more fully in his riſing from the dead, and aſcending into Heaven, and giving gifts from thence unto men: as ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence he ſaith, <hi>No man takes my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf. I have power to lay it down; and I have power to take it up again. This Commandement have I received of my Father.</hi> John 10.18.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53764:52"/>
For as it is ſaid, that he was <hi>raiſed again</hi> from the dead by his Father, and his glory: So alſo it is ſaid, that he <hi>roſe again,</hi> in, and by the power of his divine Spirit. And that <hi>he died, roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. In his Word. Preaching forth himſelf, and his own excellencies. As he ſaith, <hi>I am one that bear witneſs of my ſelf, and my Father that ſent me, he beareth witneſs of me.</hi> Though he ſaid, <hi>If I bear witneſs of my ſelf, my witneſs is not true.</hi> As implying that of himſelf, as man only, he bare not witneſs of himſelf: if as Man only, he had ſo done, his Witneſs might have been ſlighted. But he, as the Word, though made fleſh, witneſſed of himſelf; as in his works, ſo in his word too; and his witneſs, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing ſo was true. For <hi>he knew whence he came, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went.</hi> John 5.31. &amp; 8.14, 18. And ſo he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf in the Man-hood, as the Son of man, or the Word made Fleſh, to be the Son of God, to be in Heaven, and come from Heaven, and to know the things of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>John</hi> 3.11, 12, 13, 16. And ſo when he ſaid, here he <hi>muſt be lifted up;</hi> we may underſtand him to ſay, in ſuch intimations and declarations of his excellencies as thoſe were. So he teſtified of himſelf, that he is <hi>the Light of the World.</hi> John 8.12. &amp; 12.46. <hi>The bread of Life: the bread that came down from heaven. The living bread.

As therein alſo he may be blaſphemed, diſhonoured, and denied, as is implied, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. &amp; 1.16. But ſurely he ought not to be denied, blaſphemed, or put to reproch by us, or by occaſion of us. He hath not ſo deſerved of any man, but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53764:63"/>
to be bleſſed and highly honoured: And that is beſt done, when to a high commendation of him in our words, we add alſo ſuch a converſation and carriage, as ſpeaks him excellent in our eſteems and experiences of him.

               <p>Now though the lifting him up by his Father, in the acts done to him in his perſonal body, in his calling him to, upholding and accepting him in, raiſing him from, and rewarding him for and after his Sufferings, and the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſervice done and performed by him for us, be the main and moſt fundamental lifting him up; abſolutely neceſſary with reſpect to us, and our Regeneration and Salvation: Yet I apprehend, That the lifting him up alſo, as to manifeſtation and commendation of him to, and in the eyes of, others, both by the Spirit of God, and by men; eſpecially his holy Saints and Servants, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and are ſet for his Glory, and the good of others, is here alſo with the former way and acts directly included and intended. And indeed as to his being lifted up of God, both Father, Word, and Spirit, it muſt be ſo, as we have partly ſaid; becauſe it was ſo purpoſed and decreed of God. It was <hi>his purpoſe and grace given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world, that is made manifeſt now by his appearance,</hi> in what God hath wrought by, and done to him for us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10. And as for mans exalting him, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him up in his miniſtration and ſervice in the Goſpel, and in heart and life, it's no more then God requires of us; and his love, and the excellency in and love of Chriſt to us, obliges us to, and challengeth of us. And therefore ſo it muſt and ought to be alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.3, 4. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>muſt be lifted up,</hi> the neceſſity of his being lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, hath direct and main reſpect to the end whereto he

               <p n="1">1.

Where the ſhadow goes before, the body follows. And where the type and figure was fore-ordained to inſtruct into the

In the occaſion of it: There the people walking in the Wilderneſs, were diſobedient, murmured againſt God, deſpiſed his mercy, bounty, and goodneſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him in wrath to ſend fiery ſerpents among them, to bite and kill them; and as a remedy there againſt, that Serpent was commanded to be, and accordingly was lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up.

This occaſions a neceſſity of lifting up the Son of Man, both in his exaltation by God, and unto men for their healing: Yea, our firſt Parents, and we all in them, being tempted, (though in a Paradiſe) li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening to the Tempter, and ſiding with him; to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with Gods allowance to us in the Creation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one Fruit was forbidden; and to a deſire of, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting after what was unlawful and forbidden us, fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the old Serpent the Devil, and Satan:

So as by him to be ſtung and wounded to death, even a death of our ſouls and ſpirits from the life and favour of God, and of both body and ſoul to be expoſed to, and filled with miſery and miſchief to deſtruction; and as a remedy againſt that Bite, it was neceſſary Chriſt ſhould be lifted up on the Croſs, and dye for us, and be raiſed up again, and exalted to a ſtate of Power and Glory, for raiſing us up; and ſo he is, and there-through, even through thoſe things done to him in his perſonal body, we are healed: As it is ſaid, <hi>Through his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> Iſa. 53.5. 1 Pet. 2.24. But as a remedy againſt what we meet with from Satan in our ſelves, in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal deſpiſings of Chriſt, and Gods bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us through him, and provocations to anger againſt us, was, and is it needful, that he be alſo further lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by way of demonſtration, both by God and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſervants for our helpfulneſs there againſt; That <hi>whoſoever believeth on him might not periſh</hi> in a ſecond Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the place of <hi>Moſes</hi> lifting up the Serpent; That was in the Wilderneſs; So muſt the Son of Man be lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the ſtate of this world; that is, as a deſolate forſaken wilderneſs, void of all good order and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, full of briars, thorns, Wolves, Tygers, all that is evil and confuſed: Through which, while the <hi>Iſrael</hi> or followers of God walk, they meet with, and are expoſed to many trials and temptations, affections and troubles, from the barrenneſs of goodneſs, and good men that they find in it, and from the many evil men, and the unclean, covetous, oppreſſive, and wicked carriages both among themſelves, and towards them: Here in this day and ſtate it's behoveful that the Son of Man be lifted up, for the comfort, healing, and helpfulneſs of his followers againſt the evil Spirits and Serpents, and their venomous ſtings

No work of ours, nor any other order or Ordinance of God, or Man, is to be joyned with him herein, as the thing or perſon appointed of God, to heal or ſave us; or as the thing to be viewed, eyed, or truſted in, for forgiveneſs, life, or righteouſneſs. <hi>No other name</hi> (whether of thing, or perſon) <hi>given under Heaven whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> but <hi>only the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Becauſe, <hi>there is Salvation in none other beſides him.</hi> 2 Cor. 11.2, 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.11, 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. If we look for life on either ſide of him Crucified, we view a Thief, that which robs him of the honour due alone to him, and us, of his grace and bleſſing. Indeed the Ordinances of God are to be obſerved by us; even as <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo obſerved the command of God in taking a Pole, and putting the <hi>Serpent</hi> upon it; but as that was in order to the lifting up the <hi>Serpent,</hi> not as attributing any thing of medicinableneſs to the Pole, but only as a means to lift up the <hi>Serpent;</hi> that it might be ſeen; which God gave the virtue to, or by: So alſo Baptiſm, and the Supper, and Preaching, and Prayer are to be uſed: but not as if they of themſelves were of any benefit to us, but as Chriſt the Son of man is diſcovered to us, and exhibited to our view, by them, or eyed in them. They that uſe them or lift them up otherwiſe, making them the objects of their hopes, and the things as in themſelves eyed by them, abuſe them, and erre from the truth. Thoſe obſervations, as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, namely, though otherwiſe, never ſo eloquent, pithy, witty, zealous; and ſo Baptiſm, or the Supper, though as to the outward obſervation never ſo right (if any way they may be practiſed, ſo as that they preſent not, or men look beſide the Son of Man) they are but as if the Pole had been lifted up without the <hi>Serpent</hi> upon it.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53764:67"/>
without the <hi>Serpent</hi> upon it. It's Chriſt only that ſhould be the great object of our Preaching, or commendation to people; no work, order, or ordinance of, and for it ſelf: nay, no zeal, humility, love, or the like, are the things in which we are to ſeek our healing: they may (if right) be of the effects, and included in the health to be ſought in, and by Chriſt; or pious frames, in, and for the lifting up of Chriſt; but not the Medicine. It's only Chriſt, that is to be ſhewed forth to men, and looked upon, by men, that they might find healing; and ſo, that they might be rightly humble, zealous, loving, holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet as the lifting up the <hi>Serpent</hi> alone, did neither hinder the honour of God (who had not been honoured, if his order had been ſlighted; and who was honoured in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtue, and power, to ſuch his appointment; however in it ſelf, unlikely, and unable otherwiſe to produce ſuch an effect) nor was any hindrance to the deſireableneſs, or goodneſs, or to mens actual deſires, of health, and ſound recovery, but was a means to ſatisfie mens deſires, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the good, and benefit of health. So neither doth the lifting up only the Son of Man, either diſhonour; nay, but it highly honours God that ſent him, and gave him to us: <hi>(He that honoureth the Son, honoureth the Father alſo.)</hi> Nor any whit detracts, or derogates it from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirableneſs, excellency, and uſefulneſs; or the deſires after, or preſſing men to deſire, and follow after right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, charity, peace, joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are things only to be ſought, and obtained by, and through the lifting up of, and looking to Jeſus, as ſo lifted up, only for us: and therefore ſuch lifting him up, is the direct way to, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of ſuch virtues, and virtuous deſires, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, contrary to ſome mens ignorant ſuſpicions, and falſe accuſations of ſuch Doctrine and teaching. But yet there is this great difference, that the <hi>Serpent</hi> had no worth,

or uſefulneſs in it ſelf, to ſpeak of; but in order to that health, and ſafety through it to be effected, in the looker on it. But Chriſt is not only a means to virtue in us, and to the reward of it: but is in himſelf, a perſon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable excellency; and the injoyment of his favour and preſence, the very end, and reward of all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodneſs to be attained to, by all his lifting up, for, and to us; and being looked to, by us: for he is not only the <hi>Medium,</hi> or means to an end (though his fleſh, or humanity, and ſo the things done by it may be ſo look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon) but he is alſo, <hi>the</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega, <hi>the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the End, the Firſt and the Laſt.

As <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the <hi>Serpent</hi> upon the Pole, ſo highly as that it might be ſeen, or looked to by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were wounded, diſtinctly from all other things; putting nothing between to hinder the ſight of it, and lifting it up above all that might hinder its being ſeen: Even ſo is Chriſt to be lifted up above all other things, ſo as nothing may hinder the ſight, and beholding of him, by the ſinful and periſhing Soul; but ſo as he may be ſeen, and diſcerned of it, to be the only excellent, and all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient remedy for it. So hath God lifted him up above all (as well as him only, and nothing with him, either on the Croſs, or on his own right hand.) That there is nothing ſo high as he; no thing to be compared to him: nothing, no perſon, no virtue, no frame, work, ordinance, nothing viſible, or inviſible; no Angel, Principality or Power. <hi>He is ſet down in the Heavenly places</hi> (or injoyments) <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea, he is lifted up above the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> both as the Lord of the Law, for <hi>the Son of man is Lord alſo of the Sabbath.</hi> Mat. 12.8.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53764:68"/>
And as able and ſufficient to do for us, <hi>that which the Law could not,</hi> nor can <hi>do;</hi> that is, make Attonement for us; juſtifie, ſanctifie, and ſave us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.14, 19. &amp; 10 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 13.38, 39. And ſo is he alſo to be lifted up by the Preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel (for ſo is he by the holy Spirit, in the Goſpel as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by the holy Apoſtles and Prophets) above all other things, and perſons whatſoever: both as the means to our happineſs, and the Spring and Ocean of our happineſs it ſelf; as to the knowledge, and injoyment of him; and his glory. And they that lift up any other thing above him, or any otherwiſe then in him; they do not lift him up, as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the <hi>Serpent</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> nor they that put a veil over his face, or dreſs the diſcoveries, and preaching of him, with the wiſdom of man, or of words; for that is, as if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have dreſt the <hi>Serpent</hi> in ſome curious wrought cloth, or painted him over with Vermilion, (as the Idolaters did their Idols) leaſt the ſimplicity of their matter ſhould be ſeen. Thence the Apoſtle who lifted him up, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the <hi>Serpent;</hi> tells us, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent him to <hi>Preach the Goſpel, not with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of words, leaſt the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of no effect.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.17. And that when he <hi>came, declaring the Teſtimony of God, he came not with the excellency of ſpeech, or of wiſdom; for he determined to know nothing among them, but Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified: and that his ſpeech, and his Preaching, was not with the inticeing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit and Power, that their Faith might not ſtand in the wiſdom of man, but in the Power of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. As implying, that the preſenting Chriſt with ſuch paintings, and garniſhments of ſpeech hinders mens ſeeing, and beholding him, while the eye is drawn by the wiſdom of the words, from the ſimplicity and nakedneſs of the matter; and ſo the efficacy of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53764:69"/>
Croſs may be hindred. Like as the healing efficacy of the <hi>Serpent</hi> might have been by any intervening Garment, clothing it; or Paint, dawbing it over, ſo as the nakedneſs, or ſubſtance of the Braſs could not have been ſeen. And that the faith begot through ſuch wiſdom of words, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> inticeing words of Mans wiſdom, is but a human, not a divine Faith, and ſo could not have ſuch divine, and ſaving efficacies, as where it is divine; and ſuch as the nakedneſs and ſimplicity of the Truth diſcovered, and diſcerned doth effect.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the <hi>Serpent,</hi> to, and for all the wounded <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that ſo, who ever of them were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what ever were their wounds, might, looking to it, live; not excluding any of them from the intent of good by it, as ſetting it up for ſome certain number of them, only ſeperated from the reſt, and excluding the reſt; ſo as that, if any other then that number looked to it, they might not get the healing benefit of it, it being not ſet up for them; but it was lifted up for all, and every one of them, without reſpect of perſons; not as if it were for the richer, rather then for the poor; for the wiſe, rather then for the fooliſh: and without excluſion of any. So that it could be nothing, but mens own refuſal of looking to it, or neglect of it, that would hinder them of its healing efficacy. Even ſo is Chriſt, the Son of Man to be lifted up, to, and for all, and every one that is ſtung by the old <hi>Serpent,</hi> the Devil; who, or what ever they be, or how ever many, or great their wounds, ſins, or ſorrows, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of perſons, or excluſion of any, but incluſion of all, that all may ſee a way of healing, as well as know that they are wounded; and be induced to ſeek healing, in the forgiveneſs of their ſins, and renewing of their hearts and natures thereby: So as therein the goodneſs of God may be commended to all; and all have, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53764:69"/>
ſee, in crediting the Teſtimony concerning him, cauſe to thank and bleſs him, (as all Nations and People frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are called upon in the Scriptures to do.

And that, if any periſh, it may be evident, that it is through their own voluntary neglect of that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and refuſing to ſeek help in him. And ſo ſhall God looſe nothing of his glory, in their deſtruction: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he prepared his Salvation before the face of all people, ſo as all might ſee it, but they refuſed it, and by <hi>obſerving lying vanities, deprived themſelves of their own mercies.</hi> And ſo God hath lifted him up: and his holy Spirit and Servants have ſet him forth, not as one that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for an elect number, or choſen people; leaving the reſt as unprovided for of help; but <hi>for all,</hi> and <hi>every one.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6.

And that was immediately, without any intervening, or preceding courſe to be looked to: So is Chriſt to be lifted up, as the Direct means, and the immediate cure, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for all diſeaſes of the Soul, without putting men upon other rules or deviſes, courſes to prepare them for healing by him as neceſſary to be firſt looked to, of them. Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He delivered to the</hi> (Corinthians <hi>firſt of all</hi> (or <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>among the firſt things) That Chriſt dyed for our ſins according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he roſe from the dead the third day, according to the Scriptures.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.3, 4, 5. And as much leſs did <hi>Moſes</hi> go about to heal them, and then let them ſee
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53764:70"/>
the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> when ſomewhat amended firſt: So no more ſhould any go about to regulate or qualifie any firſt; for Chriſt; as if they were too badly wounded to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to look as yet to Chriſt, or for Chriſt, though look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, to heal them; till they firſt be by the Law, or ſome deviſes of men ſomewhat made better; as humble men, penitent ſinners, holy ſinners, or the like: which is, as if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have hindred ſome, from looking to the <hi>Serpent,</hi> becauſe ſo deeply, and ſo dangerouſly wounded, and their ſores ſo many, till they had got rid of ſome of them otherwiſe. And as ſuch a courſe would have been a dangerous derogation, from the virtue of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance there: ſo is this putting men upon qualifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by other means: firſt, to better them before Chriſt may be Preached to them, or they directed to look to, or behold him; a dangerous derogation from Gods order, and Ordinance here. Indeed as there, if any being wounded by a <hi>Serpent,</hi> had denied, or doubted whether he was wounded by a <hi>Serpent,</hi> and ſo needed to look to the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> it might have been neceſſary to perſwade him, and demonſtrate to him, that he was ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng; and ſo needed to apply himſelf to that way of cure, the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> for healing: So in caſe men doubt, or deny that they are Sinners, or have ſinned, and have need of Chriſt, it may be needful to ſhew, and demonſtrate to them, that they have ſin, and have ſinned, and need to look to Chriſt, that they may be ſaved. And ſo men may make uſe of the Law as a diſcoverer of Sin, to that purpoſe. And yet the beſt way to ſhew men their need for looking to Chriſt, is to lift up Chriſt as given of God, through his Death, for them to be their helper, and their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So the Apoſtle, <hi>We thus judge, that if one died for All, then all were dead.</hi> That's a demonſtration moſt certain, and effectual, that every one needs to mind him, and to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53764:71"/>
apply themſelves to him for Salvation, as being ſinners; that Chriſt hath died for them all. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. But of that way of Conviction, they have no skill that do not believe that Apoſtolical Doctrine: the denying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of which, leads them to fall upon other courſes; as neceſſary to prepare them, and make them, not only to ſee themſelves Sinners, but alſo endeavour to work ſome reformation, and good frames in them firſt, before they lift up Chriſt to them, and direct their eyes to him; that ſo they might ſee ſome cauſe; firſt, to judge that there are at leaſt ſome probable Signes of their Election in them, upon which they may ground a hope, or confidence, that Chriſt dyed for them; and ſo that there is in him ſaving virtue for healing them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to the end of their lifting up. And ſo,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the <hi>Serpent</hi> was lifted up by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as for all the ſtung People; ſo alſo, for all manner of ſtings, and wounds received from the <hi>fiery Serpents;</hi> yea, for thoſe that were inflicted, as puniſhments for ſlighting other Types, as the <hi>Manna</hi> was; for ſlighting of which, and for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt Chriſt; therein the <hi>fiery Serpents</hi> were ſent unto them, and bit them. <hi>Num.</hi> 21.5, 6. Yea, ſurely had a <hi>Serpent</hi> bitten any Man for deſpiſing the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> there had been no cure for him, but in looking to the <hi>Brazen Serpent.</hi> Even ſo the Son of Man is, and muſt be lifted up, for the pardoning, healing, and delivering from all ſins, and the miſery that comes by them. Yea, for ſinnings alſo againſt Chriſt, and the grace and bleſſing in him. There is forgiveneſs in him for our neglects of him, and wickedneſs againſt him, in refuſing to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him: while yet it is a day of grace and patience, and men be not as it were quite dead of their wounds; whence Chriſt calls them, who for ſome time have <hi>loved their ſimplicity</hi> when inſtructed by him; yea, <hi>ſcorners, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53764:71"/>
lovers of their ſcorning, and thoſe that have been ſome long time fools, and have hated and deſpiſed knowledge</hi> brought to them by him; to <hi>turn at his reproofs,</hi> promiſing to <hi>pour out his Spirit to them, and make known his words.</hi> In which is implied, that upon their turning he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give their former ſleightings of him, and ſinnings againſt him; which if they had not been to be forgiven and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooked by him, would have hindred them of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of his Grace and Spirit to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23. As thence alſo the wicked are called upon <hi>to forſake their ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon them, and abundantly pardon them,</hi> Iſa. 55.7. And Chriſt tells the unbelieving Jews, that <hi>would not come to him that they might have life,</hi> that he <hi>would not accuſe them to his Father;</hi> and that <hi>if any man heard his voice and believed not, he judged them not now, becauſe he came not into the world to judge the world, but to ſave the world,</hi> John 5.40, 45. &amp; 12.47. In which ſaying it's evident, that the world he came to ſave, includes alſo the now unbelieving perſons in it; while it's yet a day of Grace, he is ſaving them. Alſo by his Interceſſion for tranſgreſſours, as the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, and by renewed diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of patience, forbearance, and further grace to them, as appears 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.8. Yea, he prayed for ſuch as actually abuſed and crucified him; and in the repenting of ſuch afterward, he actually pardoned and forgave them, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38, 39. &amp; 3.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent, that whoſoever were ſtung with the fiery Serpents, might have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and opportunity there-through to look upon it; he declaring and informing them, that it was ſet up as a means of healing; and that it was Gods mind for giving
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53764:72"/>
healing by it, that they look up to it; and that it would not give forth any healing-virtue to them, if not beheld by them; yea probably, if not beheld till they were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if they turn'd their eye from it before its virtue had its force in and upon them, though the Serpent was the ſame, whether beheld or not beheld. Even ſo is and muſt the Son of Man be lifted up, that men may have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and opportunity of beholding him; he being not to be beheld, if not lifted up. <hi>How can they believe on him, of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without a Preacher? Or how can they preach except they be ſent?</hi> For <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.14, 17. Which makes it needful, that they that know him, and are commiſſionated of God, (as every one that hears hath commiſſion to ſay to others, Come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17.) do hold him forth, commend and magnifie him to men. It's true, that the Apoſtle there in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. propounding that queſtion. <hi>Have they not all heard?</hi> anſwers, <hi>Yes doubtleſs, their voice is gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the world, and their words to the ends of the earth:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.2, 3, 4.

And the Lord they commend and praiſe, is doubtleſs the ſame of, and to whom he ſaith, <hi>Thou Lord in the beginning haſt laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thine hands,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 102.25. Which the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> applies to the Lord Jeſus the Son of Man, by whom the Lord hath <hi>ſpoken to us in theſe laſt days,</hi> and <hi>by whom he made the worlds,</hi> Heb. 1.1, 2, 10, 11. And ſurely whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53764:72"/>
him as there lifted up and praiſed, ſo as to betake themſelves to him for help, they do and ſhall find mercy with him. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call upon the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved. In every nation he that fears God, and works righteouſneſs, is accepted of him,</hi> Rom. 10.12. Acts 10.34. <hi>They that by nature</hi> (or without verbal or vocal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction) <hi>do the things contained in the Law,</hi> (that love God and their neighbour, though uncircumciſed, or not under the outward Regiment of Gods Kingdom and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances) <hi>their uncircumciſion ſhall be accounted circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> that is, they ſhall be accepted and accounted of as Gods Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25, 26. And of thoſe that by ſuch means alſo are won in to God, I underſtand in part what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That many ſhall come from the Eaſt and from the Weſt,</hi> (even ſuch as are not the children of the Kingdom, and born under the diſtinct knowledge and Ordinances of God, as the oppoſition to them in the following words do manifeſt, wherein he adds) <hi>and ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Iſaac <hi>in the Kingdom of God, when the children of the Kingdom</hi> (ſuch as are born and brought up in the profeſſed Church, and ſo are profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly under Gods Government or Ordinances) <hi>ſhall be caſt out,</hi> Matth. 8.12. But I ſay, notwithſtanding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of this nature may be true, however God in his lifting him up in his Providences and Works, and the manifeſtations of him implicitely therein, may do for the rendring him viſible to men, that they may behold him, look to him, and be ſaved by him. Yet it concerns us as our duty, and is that which God requires of us, that we ſo lift up Chriſt in our diſtinct Preaching of him to men, that men through our miniſtration may behold him in the diſtinct expreſs declaration of him, and be ſaved from their errours, ignorances, and iniquities; which while they by their wiſdom know him not in the wiſdom of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53764:73"/>
God, as manifeſted in his works and providences, they run into. As to that purpoſe, and for that cauſe it hath pleaſed God to appoint <hi>the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. It was not another <hi>light</hi> John <hi>bare witneſs to,</hi> then that <hi>which enlighteneth every man coming into the world,</hi> and that <hi>ſhined in the darkneſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bare witneſs to it. It was not made another, in, or by his witneſs, only more plainly declared and pointed to. It was the ſame that <hi>was in the world,</hi> though <hi>the world knew him not,</hi> that <hi>came to his own,</hi> and <hi>by his own was not received;</hi> which <hi>whoſoever received,</hi> (whether of the world or of his own) <hi>were made the ſons of God.</hi> It was the ſame <hi>Word which was in the beginning with God,</hi> that in due time was <hi>made fleſh</hi> (to bring us through his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in the fleſh unto God) <hi>in whom was the life,</hi> and from whom the light came that always ſhined, and in all the world. But God to help men to diſcern him, (whom otherwiſe in his wiſdom, or more wiſe way to the view of the world (as the way of his Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is) they uſually overlook and know not) hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered gifts to men for a diſtinct and plain preaching him in a way ſeeming to the world more fooliſh, for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And <hi>in this fooliſhneſs</hi> (even the plain ungar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed way) <hi>of preaching,</hi> He is, I ſay, to be ſo held up or ſet forth, as men may have opportunity or advantage to ſee him, as given in the fleſh to the world to be their Saviour, according to Goſpel-revelation; with perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions alſo to men to mind and look to him as the great and onely one, in whom there is certain healing for them; and as one who being neglected by them, or not looked to to the end, they cannot be healed, cannot be forgiven and ſaved from their ſins, and Gods wrath and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though he be the ſame in himſelf, ſeen or not ſeen, looked to, or not looked to, believed in, or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53764:73"/>
in; Yet he is not the ſame to us, that is, he gives not forth his virtues otherwiſe then as lifted up, he is looked to, and believed on by men, (as to perſons that are in capacity, as being of years, or otherwiſe of diſcretion, as ſuch onely in a ſenſe agreeable to Scripture ſpeaking, may more properly be ſaid to be come into, ſo as to be of the world) nor can he be otherwiſe, or further then as lifted up to them, beheld by them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent, Not to the end that God might take occaſion to puniſh them the more for their neceſſitated or wilful neglects of it, or as a thing intended of God to that end; but for this gracious end, That when a Serpent had bitten any man, however of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or ſeldom, deeply, or ſleightly, he might look to the Brazen Serpent, and live. Though in caſe any man out of pride, or ſcornfulneſs, or other principles neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, he might be worthily left to dye of his wounds, and was without excuſe if he then periſhed. Even ſo the Son of Man is, and muſt be of men lifted up, not to the end, that men might harm themſelves by him, and be left without excuſe, if either through defect on Gods part of effectual Grace to enable them, they cannot (as ſome erroneouſly hold) or through wilfulneſs on their part, in neglecting the grace and power given them, they will not look to, and believe in him, and ſo periſh; But to thoſe gracious ends, that they might, when through the deceits of Sin and the Devil they fall into ſin and miſery, look up to him, and be healed by him; <hi>Not periſh, but have eternal life,</hi> both believe and live. Though if when he is lifted up to thoſe gracious ends, any man neglect to uſe the power and liberty given him of God to look to him, and in the help of his grace in ſuch looking to him, met with to believe in him; or having begun to believe,

Now that Gods ends in ordering Chriſt to be lifted up, and ſo in lifting him up are ſo gracious, and not (as ſome repreſent them) to be a ſnare to them (otherwiſe then in caſe they wilfully reject him when lifted up to thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ends, that ſuch a thing ſhall be the event, as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8.) that they might periſh. I ſay, that Gods gracious ends in it, are directly that men might believe on him; and that whoſoever ſo do, might not periſh, but have eternal life, both the next words, and the two following Verſes ſhew. The next words are, <hi>That whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> And the next Verſes confirm that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have everlaſting life.

him, and be condemned, but becauſe he neglected Gods gracious end, which was, that <hi>through him he might be ſaved,</hi> John 3.16, 17, 18. as follows Verſe 19. <hi>This is the condemnation</hi> (the reaſon of the unbelievers being condemned) <hi>that light is come into the world, but men loved darkneſs rather then light.</hi> But this I might add, as</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That men (even the World, as the next verſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) are in themſelves generally in danger of, or in the way to periſhing. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> there needed no indeavour for preventing it, if no danger of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God hath no pleaſure or likement, that they ſhould periſh; but rather that they ſhould have eternal Life. His uſing ſuch a means, or providing ſuch a remedy, to prevent the periſhing, and that men may obtain the life eternal; clearly implies that in both its branches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Son of Man is the only perſon, or <hi>Medium</hi> by whom we may be preſerved from periſhing, and obtain eternal life. And he is the <hi>Medium</hi> God hath appointed to thoſe purpoſes: This is clear in the whole ſcope of the Verſe, and in the verſes following.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That thereto it's needful (even for eſcaping per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and obtaining eternal life) and it's Gods good will that men believe on him, the Son of Man, ſo ordered of God for them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That it's the gracious mind of God, that every one that believeth on the Son of Man ſhould not (and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, whoſo believeth on him ſhall not) periſh, but have eternal life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That in order both to mens believing on him, and alſo to their not periſhing, but having eternal Life; in their ſo doing, it's Gods gracious mind, and in it ſelf need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                  </gap>ly in danger of, or in the way to periſhing. This is evidently declared in the Scriptures of truth. Yea all that God hath done to Chriſt in abaſing, and raiſing him; and all that he doth through Chriſt, in his words and works; in his calls, counſels, repoofs, corrections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are declared to be done primarily, and directly, while it is a day of his grace, and patience towards any, to prevent or keep men from periſhing, which would have been, and would be needleſs, and groundleſs, if they were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it in danger of periſhing. Far be it from us to make God, the God of Wiſdom, or <hi>only wiſe God,</hi> to do, or ſay ſo much in vain, or needleſly, or without ground or cauſe. Nor is that periſhing ſimply a bodily dying, which God doth nothing to prevent, that it ſhould not at any time, or at all come upon us; but a periſhing from Gods preſence, ſo as to be utterly loſt, miſerable, and undone.</p>
               <p>Man was wholly and univerſally fallen into ſin, and miſery, even under the ſentence of Death and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the firſt Death, in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and therein we were in danger to have periſhed; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For therein.</p>
               <p n="2">

               <p n="3">3. And from this, no man could deliver himſelf, nor be delivered by any other Creature; the ſentence of God and his Law ſtanding againſt us, and binding it upon us; which no meer Creature could bear upon himſelf, ſo, as to redeem us from it; nor had any power enough to raiſe us up from under it: for who can ſtand under, or prevail againſt God's anger. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.7, 8, 9, 11. &amp; 130.3. <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.6. If Chriſt had not dyed for us, yea and riſen again, we had all periſhed in this Death, and there had been no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection out of it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12, 18, 21, 22. But we are redeemed from this firſt death, by Jeſus Chriſt; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore <hi>given himſelf a Ranſom for all, and dyed for all,</hi> and brought all to be under his gracious Lordſhip, and diſpoſe; having ſo ſatisfied the juſtice, and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the wrath of God for that offence, as that, whereas <hi>all had ſinned and came ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> they are <hi>all juſtified by his grace,</hi> (as to that) <hi>through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>as by one offence, the Judgment was unto all men to Condemnation: So through the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one, the free gift is unto all men, to juſtification of life.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6. Rom. 14.9. &amp; 3.23, 24. &amp; 5.18. So that no man ſhall periſh in this firſt Death for ever, but all ſhall be raiſed again there-from. For, <hi>as in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye, ſo in Chriſt all ſhall be made alive.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. They ſhall not uſe that Proverb in the Reſurrection, and Judgment to come; That <hi>the Fathers have eaten ſower Grapes, and the Childrens teeth are ſet on edge: the Soul that

The Condemnation is not, nor ſhall be then, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned; but, <hi>That light came into the World, and men loved darkneſs rather then light.</hi> John 3.19. Prov. 1.24, 25, 29. Though as to the taking guilt off from the ignorant and unbelieving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in reſpect of that firſt Sin alſo (Men in their ignorance and unbelief, often charging themſelves with the guilt of that Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo, as to think themſelves therefore under Condemnation from God, and in danger of periſhing) as alſo, for purging out the corruption of Nature there-through entred, the Son of Man is to be lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the Preaching of him to men; who, though ſo delivered from that firſt Death, as that they ſhall not periſh in it: yet, as they come up into the World to be capable of chooſing the good, and refuſing the evil, are generally in danger of periſhing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In a Second Death, ſo as not to have eternal life. For,</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſer. </seg>2</label> THe Second Obſervation is, That God hath no pleaſure in the death, or periſhing of men: but that they rather ſhould have eternal life. And this is evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his own aſſertion under his oath, that we might be the more confirmed in it; as was noted above, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. Where he ſwears, <hi>As he lives, he hath no pleaſure in the death of the Wicked, but rather that he turn and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53764:81"/>
live.</hi> And ſure, if not in the wickeds, in no mans death; ſeeing it's the wicked that he every where threatens with Death. As he ſaith to the wicked in the ſame Chapter. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8 <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> And, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> Chap. 18.3, 20. And <hi>the wickedneſs of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be upon him.</hi> ver. 21. And yet he ſaith, and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he hath no pleaſure; none neither ſecret, nor revealed, that the wicked ſhould die.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And his holy ſervants aſſert the ſame, who have had his mind, and grace in their hearts, and declared it faithfully. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, <hi>That God wills all to be</hi> (or that all be) <hi>ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>God is not willing that any</hi> ſhould <hi>periſh, but that all ſhould come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> repreſents the Lord, calling <hi>all the ends of the Earth to look to him, and be ſaved.</hi> Iſa. 45.22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The many addreſſes that God, in, and through Chriſt by his Word and Spirit makes unto ſinners, to call and bring them to Repentance, that they might live, and not die; are ſo many evidences, and convincing demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of his love to Mankind: and that he hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or delight that they ſhould periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. For we may not think ſuch a wicked, and impious thought of the Almighty, who is love, and charity, truth, and goodneſs it ſelf; as if he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend one thing, and intend another. That he ſignifies one thing to be his deſire and will outwardly; and deſires and intends, the contrary inwardly: and ſo <hi>diſſembles with his lips,</hi> ſeeing he proteſts the contrary, <hi>Viz.</hi> That, <hi>the opening of his lips are right things.</hi> That <hi>he ſpeaks right things, and wickedneſs is an abomination to his lips.</hi> That <hi>his words are all right,</hi> and that <hi>there is nothing froward, or preverſe in them.</hi> Prov. 8.7, 6, 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.19. Far be it
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53764:81"/>
from us to think, that he is like to the wicked, whom his Soul abhorreth, to <hi>cover hatred with deceit:</hi> As is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.26. Now thinking holily of God, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to truth we ſhall perceive the deſire he hath of mens welfare abundantly teſtified in his addreſſes to us, diverſe ways. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his calls and counſells frequently given us. As its ſaid, <hi>Wiſdom cries out, ſhe lifts up her voice in the ſtreets; crying, how long ye ſimple, turn at my reproofs, &amp;c.</hi> Prov. 1.20.23. And <hi>doth not Wiſdom cry, and Underſtanding lift up her voice?</hi> Can that be denied? Is not that evident? and that to men indefinitely, yea, and to the worſt of them: therefore it follows, that <hi>ſhe ſtands in the top of high places,</hi> where, and whence ſhe may beſt be heard, and cries, <hi>To you O men I call, and my voice is to the Sons of Men. O ye ſimple underſtand wiſdom, and ye fools, be ye of an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart.</hi> Prov. 8.1, 2, 4, 5. And ſo, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die O houſe of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. Yea, this was one great end of our Saviours coming into the World, in order to his ſaving the World. <hi>Viz. To call ſinners to Repentance.</hi> Mat. 9.13. John 12.47.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his promiſing them great and glorious things, upon their hearing, and obeying his calls. <hi>Turn ye at my reproofs: behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my words.</hi> Prov. 1.23. So in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.32, 33. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me: watching daily at my Gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors. For whoſo findeth me, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth life: and ſhall obtain favour of the Lord. Aske and ye ſhall receive, ſeek and ye ſhall find.</hi> Mat. 7.7, 8. And abundance the like.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his threatning ſinners, if they will take the courſe to periſh, and will not liſten to his counſels. As, <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed; I ſtretched out my hands, and no man regarded: I alſo will laugh at your calamities, I will mock
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53764:82"/>
when your fear cometh.</hi> Prov. 1.24, 26, &amp;c. <hi>O wicked man thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Ezek. 33.8. And many the like.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In his reproving, expoſtulating, and reaſoning the caſe with men, that he might perſwade them to their own good. <hi>Why will ye die O houſe of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come to the waters, and ye that have no money: come, buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, and without price. Why will ye lay out money for that, that is not bread, and your labour, for that, that ſatisfieth not?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In his chaſtening men alſo, for their follies, in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting and refuſing their own mercy, in order to their awakning to Repentance, that they might live. As he ſaith, <hi>I ſmote them</hi> thus and thus, <hi>yet they turned not to me ſaith the Lord.</hi> As implying, that he ſmote them to that end they might turn. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6, 7, 11. <hi>All theſe things doth God twice, and thrice with men, that he might keep them from going down to the pit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job.</hi> 33.29.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In his exerciſing long patience, and forbearance towards them, with much bounty and goodneſs to the ſame end, that is, <hi>To lead them to repentance.</hi> As is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.5. With 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. <hi>Waiting that he may be gracious.</hi> Yea,</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next Obſervation is an evident confirmation of the truth of this; Namely, the gift of Gods only Son, the Son of Man: for if he gave his only begotten Son to be the Saviour of the World; evident it is then, that he loved the World: and if he loved it, he deſired not, that it ſhould periſh, but rather, be ſaved through him, and obtain eternal life. But that is true, as it is ſaid in <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. And as we may ſee alſo in our ſpeaking to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Object.</hi> But the Scripture ſaith, that the World go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Deſtruction. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 32. Or ſhall be condemned.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, but that is, becauſe it goeth contrary to what God would have it; it diſobeys, and rebells againſt his will, and doth that which pleaſeth him not. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3, 4. <hi>John</hi> 3.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Object.</hi> But God hated <hi>Eſau</hi> before he was born, therefore had pleaſure in his Death, and periſhing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not ſaid, that God hated him before he was born; but only that <hi>the Elder people (Eſau</hi> namely, and his Poſterity) <hi>ſhould ſerve the younger;</hi> that is, <hi>Jacob</hi> and his. See, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.12. The other of hating <hi>Eſau</hi> was ſaid in <hi>Malachie's</hi> time. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2. long after <hi>Eſau</hi> was dead; and was ſaid of his Poſterity when <hi>he laid their Mountains waſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Object.</hi> But the Apoſtle adds this of <hi>Eſau's</hi> being hated, to that ſaid, before they were born, as a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its truth: and therefore that ſaying, alſo refers to the ſame time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That follows not, for it confirms the truth of the former ſaying, though underſtood of <hi>Eſau</hi> national<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in <hi>Malachie's</hi> time: For Gods laying <hi>Eſaus</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains waſt for his hatred againſt his Brother; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in teſtifying hatred againſt <hi>Eſau</hi> in his Poſterity, when as he more gently chaſtiſed <hi>Jacob</hi> in his poſterity: was an evidence of Gods reſolving to make good his purpoſe of making him a ſervant to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as nationally conſidered: Gods deſtroying the Elder, for not ſerving the younger, was a demonſtration that his place was, to have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him: but if we ſhould refer this hatred to the ſame time; yet then</p>
               <p n="2">2. Leſs love, is in Scripture called hatred: and ſo Gods leſs love, in reſpect of purpoſe to ſhew him grace, and give him honour and priviledges, might be called his hatred; and ſtand well enough, with a deſire of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that he might not periſh. As we are willed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53764:83"/>
in ſuch a ſenſe, to hate thoſe, whoſe deſtruction yet we may not deſire; yea, whoſe good and happineſs we are greatly to deſire, and endeavour; as our <hi>Fathers, Mothers, Brethrens, &amp;c.</hi> whom we are to hate, that is, love leſs then Chriſt; ſo as to be willing to diſpleaſe, or forſake them, for Chriſts ſake. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. So may God be ſaid to hate in ſuch a ſenſe alſo.</p>

That is not ſo ſaid, but that he <hi>might ſhew his power in him, and make his name to be declared in all the Earth.</hi> And that he might do, and yet deſire his Salvation. Yea, (as <hi>Origen,</hi> in his <hi>Philocal.</hi> alſo notes) He might order thoſe Judgments to him, and harden him, that he might bring them upon him, to the bodily death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to awaken him to Repentance; and to prevent his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing hereafter. Sometimes God puniſhes men here to Death, that they might not periſh for ever. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31, 32. But granting him to be periſhed.</p>

ſend divers of his Angels with gracious meſſages, and his <hi>Law was given by the diſpoſition</hi> of them.

This is Love indeed paſſing all parallel; yea, all knowledge. Surely we need not (as the Phariſees) ſeek after another or greater ſign from Heaven, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not our ruine, but our ſalvation and happineſs; but may well reſt in this unſpeakable gift of God, as a ſufficient demonſtration thereof to us; accepting it with all reverence, love, and thankfulneſs. <hi>This is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying, and worthy all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.

Surely this may engage us alſo,</p>
               <p>Secondly, To think well of God, to land and bleſs him perpetually as our great Benefactor, our merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, our mighty, yea, almighty Helper; as one that ſo deſired our good, ſo loved the world, as to ſend us
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53764:86"/>
ſuch a one to ſave us. He may well expect from us, and we give to him upon this account all poſſible love, thanks, dutifulneſs, and ready obedience. He is worthy to be honoured by us, that had ſuch a reſpect for us. Well may we cry out with admiration, <hi>Lord, what is man that thou ſhouldſt ſo magnifie him, and that thou ſhouldſt ſo ſet thine heart upon him,</hi> as to ſend thine own and onely Son (not by Adoption and Regeneration a Son onely, but by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and divine Generation thine onely begotten Son) to be the Son of Man, and ſo in Relation and of Kindred to him, to help and ſave him when none elſe could help him. This was <hi>the Lords own doing,</hi> and greatly worthy our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And well may we accept of and confide in ſuch a one as this Son of Man, Gods onely Son, as a perſon fit and meet, and All-ſufficient to ſave us, and to bring us to Heaven and Happineſs. Good encouragement may this conſideration give us (as well as it ſhews us a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there being Salvation and Life in none other for us) to hearken to him, and give up our ſelves, wich full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith, and expectation of good ſucceſs to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and diſpoſe We need not fear but God will be with him to help him in, and carry him on with ſucceſs in all his undertakings for us, ſeeing God is in him, and he is God. When God ſends any on any gracious meſſage, he uſes to accompany them, and give them good ſucceſs. So he was with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> when he ſent them to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and gave them a command to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they effected it in his name; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many threatning difficulties and diſcouragements they encountred with; though they were but Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, neither of them his proper Son. Indeed they led not the people into <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe they failed in their faith in; and obedience to him, not ſanctifying him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53764:87"/>
them at the waters of ſtrife. He ſent <hi>Joſhua</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to lead them in thither, expelling and driving out the Gentiles to divide the Land to <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And God was with him therein, and did not <hi>fail</hi> him nor <hi>forſake</hi> him or them that followed him, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his commands, but made them ſucceſsfull by his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſence. He was with <hi>Gideon</hi> alſo, when he ſent him againſt their enemies; ſo as with a ſmall handful, by unlikely means, he vanquiſhed an innumerable number of enemies. And what ſhould I mention <hi>David, Cyrus,</hi> and divers others?</p>
               <p>Now if God ſtrengthned his ſervants always in their obedience to him in what he ſent them to do, how ſhall we queſtion or doubt the Sufficiency and prevailing power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his onely Son, with whom, and in whom <hi>he was reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> and is ſtill after a more wonderful way of preſence, and union of Being, then with any of them? Surely we may have high expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Life and Salvation by him; He being ſent of God to ſuch purpoſes to and for us; He being neither liable to ſin, (as <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and many others did) nor hath death any place upon him, much leſs dominion, as it had over all them, ſo as that he ſhould fail there-through in his undertakings, till he hath perfected what concerns us. Indeed his undertakings, or the things God ſent him to do, are and were of a far higher nature, and heavier then ever he ſent any others about; As to take away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelf, Deſtroy the power of Satan, Aboliſh death through his own death, And to ſave our ſouls: But by how much his work was, and is greater, by ſo much is his perſon more excellent and glorious. And why then ſhould we not thankfully entertain and embrace him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on and truſt to him, yielding up our ſelves to his gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance with greateſt confidence, and fulleſt aſſurance both
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53764:87"/>
of his ſufficiency and faithfulneſs? For in that he is Gods Son, his onely Son, he hath his power, and virtue, ſtrength and all-ſufficiency, rendring him able to ſave us. And in that he is his onely begotten, he hath in him his perfect likeneſs and ſimilitude; and therefore God being Love or Charity, full of goodneſs and faithfulneſs to us, he is ſo alſo, being the expreſs character of his perſon, the brightneſs of his Glory.

Yet, we may here lay down two or three cautions to prevent miſtake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caution</hi> 1. Firſt, that theſe things are to be underſtood as to actual believing, with reſpect to perſons capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thoſe namely that are adult, or of years of diſcretion; not of Infants incapable of hearing, and of underſtanding; as for them they being caſt upon God and his mercy from the Womb, they may be interpreted, and by Grace repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as believers and truſters in God; not being capable of acting, much leſs actually acting any diſtruſt in him: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9. <hi>Thou art he that didſt take me out of my Mothers
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53764:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Womb, thou madeſt me hope upon my Mothers breaſt.</hi> So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.5, 6. To which alſo may be applyed that of our Saviour. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that believeth in me, &amp;c.</hi> The like may be ſaid of Idiots, however, that they may not be reputed as unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, not having capacity of believing; otherwiſe it ſhould be a ſign of reprobation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caution</hi> 2. Secondly, that actual Faith or Belief in Chriſt, is not required in perſons of diſcretion, further then according to the means of believing that God affords them. They are not reputed unbelievers further then they refuſe or receive not what is preſented to them to believe; or might and would be, if that which leads thereto were not rejected by them. Chriſt requires not an explicite belief of what they have, or might have no explicite declaration of. In that caſe, if men <hi>by nature keep the Law, their uncircumciſion ſhall be accounted Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> as was noted before, and as is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26. <hi>He that in every Nation</hi> (by whatſoever means God affords them for it) <hi>fears God and works Righteouſneſs is accepted of him.</hi> As <hi>Cornelius</hi> was in his Prayers and Almes before <hi>Peter</hi> had ſpoken any thing of the Doctrine of Chriſt to him. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 34.

Salvation, believing on Chriſt is abſolutely neceſſary, and thereto, the Preaching of Chriſt alſo to men, that they may believe. The reaſon is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God will have his Son honoured by men, even as He (the Father) is honoured in their coming to him, and believing on him for life and Salvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, 23. Now herein men honour Chriſt, in giving to him what God hath given him, <hi>viz.</hi> The honour and glory of giving eternal life; and in that perſwaſion coming to him, ſeeking and accepting it of him, and herein men diſhonour him, in thinking unworthily of him, rejecting, and putting him away; and refuſing the life and grace he tenders to them. It is but a juſt reward and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his Sons abaſement, and ſufferings for us; that we give him that honour to own him for our Saviour, and ſeek and truſt to him for his Salvation. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive power, riches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12.

                  </gap>m, for, and diſpenſation of them to us, according to our needs. To which end,</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath not ordered that Chriſt ſhould have all the weight of our ſins and ſufferings, and then we to have the benefits and procurements immediately put into our hands, or made over to us, and to our injoyments; but God hath given all things into his hands, <hi>power, and riches, ſtrength, and wiſdom, honour, glory, and bleſſing,</hi> even to him that bare, and ſuffered all the evil for us; as, He is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthy. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>John</hi> 3.35. &amp; 13.3. He gives us eternal life, but he gives us it in his Son: ſo as that to the receiving thereof, we muſt receive him, and ſubmit our ſelves unto him, and his Government. As it is ſaid, <hi>This is the Record that God hath given of his Son.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53764:89"/>
God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that bath not the Son, hath not life.</hi> 1 John 5.11, 12. And ſo it's ſaid, That <hi>God hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual bleſſings in Chriſt.</hi> Electing us in him, Predeſtinating us to the Adoption of Sons in him, that we have in him Redemption, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, and are accepted in him <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And ſo, that we ſhould be <hi>ſtrong in the grace in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.1. So that He is the Treaſury, as well as the procurer of all Grace and Bleſſing for us; and we are to come to him for it: then that charge, <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</hi> John 5.40. And that to the end.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The proviſion of Life and Righteouſneſs, and all bleſſing might be ſure and ſtedfaſt for us; for it is <hi>the will of him that ſent him, that of all that which he hath given him, he ſhould looſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day,</hi> John 6.39. <hi>He will keep that, that is committed to him.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12. Life and Righteouſneſs were given us in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but he fell and loſt them: and were they put into our keeping, we might looſe and forfeit them irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably too, and provoke God to take them from us. But Chriſt <hi>will not fail.</hi> Iſa. 42.4. Nor will God <hi>take away his mercy from him.</hi> Pſal. 89.33. So that if we fail and forfeit, yet it abides ſure in him ſo, as ſeaſonably and ſoundly returning to him we may be reſtored again. As alſo that,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He might gather us into an unity in him, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gathering us from our ſelves, and from our own natural conditions, places, or objects of hope and truſt, and ways of walking into him; that we all centring in him, and having our hopes, truſts, and rejoycings in him, and walking in him we might be made one among our ſelves; and not be as it were many, ſcattered and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53764:90"/>
from him: ſo it's ſaid to have been the good pleaſure of God, <hi>in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of time, to gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, even in him.</hi> Epheſ. 1.10. And that <hi>He is our peace who hath made both one, and hath broken down the wall of partition between us, having aboliſhed the enmity in his fleſh, to make in himſelf of twain, one new man; ſo making peace.</hi> Eph. 2.14, 15, 16. <hi>Sathan</hi> by drawing us from God, had drawn us into diviſions after diverſe Gods, and into diverſe ways of Worſhip, or prophaneſs; and into diſſentions, hatreds, and oppoſitions. God is a God of love, unity, peace, and concord; and therefore will have all that live under his Government, live in peace, unity, and love, agreeing together in one; and therefore hath put all his riches of grace and glory into him, that all faces might be turned towards him, all hearts knit to him, and meet in him, and ſo be at one. As it's ſaid, <hi>Chriſt died not for that Nation</hi> (of the <hi>Jews) only, but to gather together into one, the children of God that are ſcattered abroad.</hi> John 11.51, 52. This was of old figured in the Unity of the Temple and Altar in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to which all the Tribes out of all quarters were to repair. Again that,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he might make us an holy People, that are to live with him for ever. He is a holy God, and his deſign in ſaving us by his Son, is to ſave us from our ſins, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, filthineſs, and fooliſhneſs; and ſo to make us a wiſe, clean, gracious, and good people: a people <hi>redeemed from all iniquity, and purified to be a peculiar people for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, zealous of good works.</hi> Tit. 2.12, 13, 14. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. Luk. 1.74, 75. His deſign is not, that we ſhould ſtill live in our ſins, which had ſo far provoked him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as to ſentence us to Death, and to condemn us to Hell. It is not poſſible that he ſhould allow us to live with him, in that which is ſo hateful to him: Yea, ſo hateful, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53764:90"/>
his own onely begotten Son might not obtain a releaſe of us, from the puniſhment incurred by it, but by his dying and ſuffering the curſe of the Law threatned againſt us for it; no, without holineſs we may not ſee God: nor live in his ſight. Now to have given us happineſs, and life everlaſting by Chriſt, without coming to him, and ſo to God who is in him, had been to make us happy in ſin; for what is ſin but a diſtance, or going of the Soul from God! And what is living in ſin, but living at a diſtance from God, in a neglect, or diſregard of him? But now the believing in Chriſt, and ſo in God by him (for <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him, believeth not on him, but on him that ſent him.</hi> John 12.46) Is the way to be holy, pure, good, wiſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; for this believing in him, hath in it a beholding of his excellencies which are of a conforming efficacy to him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Yea, herein the Soul is drawn from all polluting, defiling objects, which ſpoil, beſot, and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Soul, and debauch it, to live on him, and in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with, or dependance on him: the fountain of all cleanneſs; waſhing it from all filthineſs; the fountain of wiſdom cleanſing it from all fooliſhneſs, and bruitiſhneſs, and filling it with heavenly wiſdom and underſtanding: the fountain of all power, healing it of its weakneſſes, and infirmities, and inabling it to reſiſt temptations to evil, and to walk in every good way, and perform any ſervice to which he calls it: The fountain of all goodneſs, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from all bad and evil diſpoſitions and deſires, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it with the contrary, of all nobleneſs and excellency, healing it of all baſeneſs, and unworthineſs, and ſpiriting it for all noble, and truly excellent undertakings and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. In a word, in coming to him, it comes to all righteouſneſs, purity, and goodneſs, and in depending, and living on him, it derives all excellent, clean, holy, and good virtues, qualities, and diſpoſitions from him, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53764:91"/>
it ſuitable to God and his holineſs. Yea, and</p>
               <p n="4">4. Everlaſting, or Eternal Life, being, or ſtanding in the <hi>knowledge of God, and of him whom he hath ſent, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and that knowledge being not to be had, or attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, but in the Souls coming to Chriſt, and depending on him and his teaching; drinking that in. (He being otherwiſe in himſelf unknowable, and inviſible, but as that word from his boſom declares him; and that image of his inviſible Majeſty, repreſents him. <hi>John</hi> 1.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1.2.3.) Its not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ſhould have eternal life, or not periſh or want of it, but in believing in, and depending on him, as making known himſelf to us, and his Father in him. Wherefore life eternal being only in him, and not injoyable by us, but in and with him; and the way to unity and holineſs which he deſignes in thoſe that live, being only attainable by believing in, and living upon him, therefore he alſo calls us to him to behold, liſten to, believe, and truſt in him: as to this end alſo Chriſt calls us to himſelf, that in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him, we might not periſh, but have eternal life. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. &amp; 45.22. &amp; 55.1.4. &amp; 65.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29. <hi>John</hi> 7.37.38, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:53764:91"/>In which deſcription, I have endeavoured to take in all thoſe various terms which the holy Ghoſt uſeth in the Scriptures to expreſs its Nature by: as alſo to ſhew its true Principle, and ſpring from which it is produced, and by which it is maintained, in its proper ſubject. For here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That from which it ſprings, or flowes, is ſaid to be an hearty belief, or credit giving to Gods teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and the perception of his excellencies, as therein diſcovered; or rather, that teſtimony it ſelf, and his excellencies as therein diſcovered, for the believing in, or on the Lord, is an effect of the believing God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that phraſe or ſaying, <hi>Abraham believed in the Lord.</hi> Gen. 15.6. Is by the Apoſtle rendred, <hi>Abraham believed God.</hi> Rom. 4.3. As implying, that then God is heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his Teſtimony when he whom he teſtifies of, is believed in; as alſo, that the believing in the Lord is an evidence, and product of believing God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is mentioned alſo, the ſeveral cauſes of this perſwaſion, and ſo by conſequent of that perception, and believing on Chriſt that follows upon it. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The principal and firſt cauſe, the Author and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter of this faith, belief, or perſwaſion, and of all that follows upon it, is God himſelf teſtifying of Chriſt. As it is ſaid, <hi>Ye are ſaved by grace through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> Eph. 2.8. And, <hi>this is the work of God</hi> (both that which he requires of us, and that which he works in us) <hi>That ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> Joh. 6.29. Yea, and our Saviour further teſtifies it to be the work wrought of God, in ſaying, <hi>No man can come to me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father that hath ſent me draw him.</hi> v. 44. And <hi>No man can come to me, except it be given to him of my Father.</hi> Ver. 65.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of him deſcendeth, and cometh down every good and perfect giving.</hi> And therefore, both this perſwaſion, and all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through effected: But he works mediately, and ſo here is,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:53764:92"/>2. The ſubordinate and mediate cauſe of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion and believing, on Gods part; which is the ſame that is alſo the object believed, even the Word and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God; the very clearneſs, excellency, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of which, as manifeſted of God to the heart, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the heart to embrace and credit it: As by the light of the ſun a man ſees the ſun; ſo the goodneſs and truth of Gods Teſtimony is ſeen by its own brightneſs, and that draws in the heart to receive it. By his word God wrought at firſt in making the world, and by his word he works, in making new creatures. And that this is that by which he works in the heart, and perſwades it to believe on Chriſt our Saviour, himſelf teſtifieth, in ſaying, John 6.45. <hi>They ſhall all be taught of God; every one therefore that hears and learns of the Father, comes to me.</hi> Thence alſo his word, the Teſtimony he beareth of Chriſt, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is called <hi>the word of faith,</hi> Rom. 10.8. But yet this produceth not this believing without ſome act of man, which is, and may be called,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſubordinate cauſe or means on mans part, that without which this believing is not effected; and that is expreſſed to be a ſerious liſtening to that word. Whence that in Iſa. 55.3. <hi>Hear and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi> And in Rom. 10.17. <hi>Faith is of hearing, and hearing is of the word of God.</hi> They that ſtop their ear leſt they ſhould hear, deprive themſelves of the efficacy of God and his word, even of the Spirit of God breathing and working in the word, and are juſtly left of God to their perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unbelief, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13, 14, 15. I add the word ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to ſignifie, that it is not a careleſs, formal hearing, but a diligent attentive hearing. Such as our Saviour ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in that double expreſſion; <hi>Every one that heareth and learneth</hi> (ſo heareth as alſo to learn) <hi>of the Father, comes to me.</hi> Such a hearing as includes that which <hi>Moſes</hi> called
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53764:92"/>
on the people to do, when he ſaid, <hi>Set your hearts to all theſe words,</hi> Deut. 32.46. Or as that in Heb. 2.1. <hi>A gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving earneſt heed to the things ſpoken</hi> in the Goſpel. And this leads to the next, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The proper ſubject of this perſwaſion, belief, and ſo alſo of the perception; and all that follows upon it, and that is the heart, as it is ſaid, <hi>With the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10.10. And indeed when men ſet their hearts to attend to Gods words, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them, God will perſwade their hearts; and the heart perſwaded and believing, is there-through both framed to do righteouſneſs in believing on Chriſt, and alſo is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and juſtified of God therein, and the man accounted of God righteous. And in both theſe ſenſes the words may be underſtood, that <hi>with the heart man believes unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> Many there are that profeſs and ſay they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and are perſwaded of the truth of Gods word; and yet they are far from believing on Chriſt, (as their lives make manifeſt in many of them) becauſe they believe not with the heart; their hearts are not ſet to, or ingaged in the matter. They may learn ſo much of the form of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in ſubſerviency to ſome other deſigns, (as of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a livelihood, honour and reſpect with men, eaſe from troubles of mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) as that they may <hi>draw nigh with their mouths, and honour him with their lips, and yet their hearts be removed far from him, going after their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or what they mainly deſign, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. And theſe attain not to righteouſneſs. They neither ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to God and Chriſt that which is right, juſt, and meet, <hi>viz.</hi> that honour, fear, faith, truſt, and affection that he is worthy of: Nor are they therefore juſtified and accepted of God as righteous perſons. But when men ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Gods Teſtimony as to believe on Chriſt, their minds, wills, and affections are all ingaged therein, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53764:93"/>
through the preſence and operation of the Spirit of God (which is always ready to help and ſave, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to effect what he requires, and is needful to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in them that attend to him, and as he is preventing them by his grace, yield up themſelves to him) they are ſtrengthened and framed to all the acts and exerciſes both conducing to, and contained in this believing on Chriſt the Son of Man. Which are alſo in this deſcription ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, both</p>
               <p n="4">4. The acts productive of, and the acts contained in the believing on Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The acts productive of it, are</p>
               <p n="1">1. An heart-perſwaſion or belief of the truth of God, or of the word that he ſpeaks and teſtifies concerning Chriſt; as of him we have largely ſhewed that he teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. This is properly the believing God, and the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt, and the believing his Prophets and Servants in their teſtimony, as ſpeaking forth the word of God, and of Chriſt; and they that ſo do, are in the way <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.20. This is that by which the faith or belief of the Patriarchs is expreſſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>They ſee the promiſes afar off, and were perſwaded of them.</hi> And they whoſe hearts are perſwaded of God to believe his teſtimony, (<hi>as God will perſwade</hi> Japheth, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſible, as ſome render <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. thoſe that meekly hear and attend, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.8. <hi>James</hi> 1.18, 19—21.) in them alſo is certainly effected,</p>
               <p n="2">2. A heart-perception of the Excellencies of Chriſt: Eor as God in his Doctrine beareth witneſs to his Son, the Son of Man; ſo there is nothing to be ſaid of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing in him but what is excellent; for <hi>in him all fulneſs dwells;</hi> and he is <hi>fairer then the children of men; the chiefeſt</hi> (or he that carries the banner) <hi>among ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi> The moſt powerful, wiſe, juſt, holy, merciful and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53764:93"/>
gracious one. And <hi>the entrance of Gods word</hi> concerning him <hi>gives light</hi> (diſcovers the excellencies in him, the Forgiveneſs of ſins, Redemption, Spirit and Spiritual Bleſſings, the Grace and Glory in him) and <hi>it gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the ſimple:</hi> It gives ſight to diſcern the light, and what is diſcovered in and by it: It opens <hi>the eyes of the blind, and makes wiſe the ſimple,</hi> Pſal. 19.7, 8, 9. &amp; 119.130. And ſo the Soul perceives the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of Chriſt; That he is the excellent and precious one; <hi>Beautiful and glorious, excellent and comely,</hi> Iſa. 4.2. however he appears to others, whoſe eyes are not opened; but they are yet ſpiritually bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d, or are blinded of Sathan for their not believing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. Yet the enlightened Soul ſees him worthy to be adhered to above all other things and perſons; worthy above all to be loved, and to be believed on. Thus the Apoſtles (whoſe <hi>eyes were bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed becauſe they ſee) ſaw in him as the glory of the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father, full of grace and of truth:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pronounced of him, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the living God; and whither ſhould we go, thou haſt the words of eternal life,</hi> &amp;c. John 1.14. &amp; 6.68, 69. Matth. 16.16. Now from this perſwaſion of the truth of Gods Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I ſay, and this perception of his Excellencies diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, flow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The acts contained in the believing on Chriſt, wherein the believing on him properly ſtands, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, which the Scripture variouſly expreſſeth. To take in all which, I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's a hearty betaking of the Soul, or of a mans ſelf to Chriſt. In which expreſſion I include and intend what our Saviour or the Evangeliſts expreſſes in two uſed by them, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>receiving Chriſt;</hi> which hath reſpect or refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his being given of God to us, and coming in his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53764:94"/>
name, and tendring himſelf to us to be our Saviour, Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Healer; and in order thereto, our Prophet, Maſter, or Teacher our King, Commander, Protector and Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, our precious Sacrifice, and perfect High Prieſt; yea, our Lord and our God. Now he that betakes himſelf to him, receives him with all acceptation as ſuch a one; as the great gift of God and of himſelf, unto, and for all thoſe exerciſes of his authority over us; and grace toward us, unto which he is given, and which he tenders: And this is interpreted in the Scripture it ſelf, to be believing on him, or on his name, John 1.12. <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not; but to as many as received him, he gave power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believed on his name.</hi> This phraſe alſo our Saviour uſes to ſignifie the believing on one, <hi>John</hi> 5.43, 44. And ſo he that believes on him, receiving him as the Prophet and Teacher ſent of God, receives alſo his ſayings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, reproofs, counſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and receiving him as the Lord and King, receives his commands; yea, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him as the great High Prieſt receives him, ſo as to come to God by his Sacrifice; yea, receiving him as God receives his ſayings and commands as the moſt ſovereign and abſolute ſayings and commands of God: To which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo tends,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The coming to him.</hi> This alſo is included in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on him, and ſo in the betaking a mans ſelf to him; yea, ſo as to go from all other to him. For receiving him as ſuch a one, the Soul comes to him, or betakes it ſelf to him from all others that may ſtand in competition with him, to be taught, inſtructed, counſelled, commanded; and ſo to be helped, healed, protected and ſaved by him, and to obtain bleſſing from God by his Sacrifice and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation. And this phraſe alſo is often uſed to expreſs and ſignifie the believing on him: As when it's ſaid, <hi>Ye
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53764:94"/>
will not come to me, that ye might have life,</hi> John 5.40. <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall not hunger,</hi> John 6.35. <hi>If any man thirſt let him come to me and drink;</hi> which in the next verſe is, <hi>He that believeth on me,</hi> John 7.37, 38. and many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. Now this coming is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt and principally of the heart and inward man, liking, prizing, loving, and looking to him for all grace and bleſſing; and ſuch is the <hi>believing heart,</hi> a heart <hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh,</hi> or <hi>cleaving to him with purpoſe or reſolution,</hi> Heb. 10.22. Acts 11.24. As the unbelieving heart is called an <hi>evil heart withdrawing</hi> or departing <hi>from the living God,</hi> Heb. 3.12. &amp; 10.39. An <hi>heart removed far from the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 29.13. or <hi>departing from him,</hi> Jer. 17.5, 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondarily, as the way to, and an effect of the former, it contains and leads to a coming to him in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and the appointments of God, (as to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Societies of Gods people where he is ſpiritually preſent, and exerciſing his power, and diſpenſing his grace and bleſſing) in a bodily coming thereto, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24, 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It's a yielding up a mans ſelf to him; which as it is alſo included in the receiving Chriſt, the admitting or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining him in his Doctrine, counſels, reproofs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and ſo in the exerciſe of his Prieſtly power with God, and Princely Authority over us and all things; ſo it alſo hath in it that reſigning up a mans ſelf to his gracious guidance and government, which is required of us, and that obeying him, which is to be exerciſed by us; as is implied in that ſaying, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>That being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he became the author of eternal ſalvation to all that obey him;</hi> which is put there for that which here and in other places is believing on him: Obedience to him in yielding to his counſels and commands, and ſo in being ruled and governed by him, being a neceſſary and indiſpenſible fruit
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53764:95"/>
or exerciſe of the faith, or believing on him to which the promiſes are made; exerciſed alſo and practiſed by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and approved believers recorded in the Scripture, whoſe faith we are to follow; as is to be ſeen in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7, 8—17. Whence the unbelievers are called <hi>the children of diſobedience,</hi> and judgment threatned to them as ſuch, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.6. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. This expreſſion of yielding a mans ſelf to the Lord, we have in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Yield your ſelves</hi> (or as the Margent hath it, <hi>Give your hands) to the Lord;</hi> who is ſtretching out his hand to us to ſuccour and ſupply us, to pull us out of the ſnares of ſin and Sathan, and to bring or lead us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Sanctuary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. It's an attendance to him alſo, called in Scripture ſometimes, <hi>a looking to him,</hi> as ſeeking and expecting all grace and bleſſing from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.5. and <hi>a waiting upon, and for him,</hi> in obſerving all his Ordinances and Appointments, and him in them all, and to receive commands, counſels, and help from him, and waiting patiently upon him for them. Whence thoſe expreſſions of, <hi>Wait on the Lord,</hi> and <hi>wait I ſay on the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 27.14. &amp; 37.34. And <hi>they that wait on the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 40.31. Yea, and in this waiting, a diligent liſtening to him, and obſerving his ſayings, and looking for his help, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. &amp; 130.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It's a dependance or reliance on him; as believing him, and him onely able, willing, and faithful to help and ſave: And this includes in it (as alſo the betaking a mans ſelf to him doth)</p>
               <p n="1">1. A renouncing it ſelf and all confidence in it ſelf, its own power, ſtrength, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, worth or merit, as altogether weak and unprofitable to help, ſave, or ſatisfie it, <hi>denying a mans ſelf,</hi> Matth. 26.24. And</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:53764:95"/>2. A rejecting all confidence or dependance on others, whether things or perſons, beſides Chriſt and God in him; as believing alſo an utter inſufficiency or unfaithfulneſs in them, and every of them, to help, ſave, or ſatisfie us (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of mediation for obtaining favour, or diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of favours obtained; either as to teaching and counſel, or as to power and ſtrength for defence and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that <hi>in vain ſalvation is looked for to the hills or mountains,</hi> or any thing beſides him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.23. And alſo,</p>
               <p n="3">3. In betaking and yielding up it ſelf to him; there is a leaving it ſelf wholly with him to his guidance, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, diſpoſe and ordering; as believing it ſhall find what it wants, or is good for it, in, and with, and from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1, 2. &amp; 121.1, 2. &amp; 84.11, 12. Rom. 8.32. And</p>
               <p n="4">4. Going forth to act and obey, bear and ſuffer what he orders (not in its own wiſdom and ſtrength, or in other creatures, but) in his light and direction, ſtrength and ſufficiency expected and given; as it was ſaid to <hi>Gideon, Go forth in this thy ſtrength,</hi> namely, that which God in looking upon him gave him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.14. So <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord God, and make mention of his righteouſneſs, and of his onely,</hi> Pſal. 71.16. And <hi>they ſhall walk up and down in the name of the Lord,</hi> Zech. 10.12. Yielding up themſelves to obey and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and relying on him for his direction and guide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therein to go before them, ſhewing and leading them in the way; and for his ſtrength to enable, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſave them harmleſs therein: As <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, when they followed God in the wilderneſs, through the ſea, and over <hi>Jordan.</hi> This is alſo called <hi>a ſtaying on the Lord,</hi> or <hi>on his arm</hi> or <hi>name,</hi> or a <hi>leaning</hi> thereon, Iſa. 10.20. &amp; 50.10. Cant. 8.5. or on the worth and prevalency of his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53764:96"/>
Sacrifice and Mediation for all our acceptance. And this with truſt or confidence. And ſo</p>
               <p n="5">V. It's a committing a mans ſelf, and way, and all his concernments to the Lord, with an hope, truſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and confidence that he will not fail or forſake him; ſo as to check all ariſing fears either of Gods fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or of any mans or devils prevailing againſt him. <hi>I will truſt and not fear; for the Lord Jehovah is my ſtrength and ſong; and he alſo is become my ſalvation,</hi> Iſa. 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. We may boldly ſay, <hi>The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto me,</hi> Pſal. 56.3, 4—10, 11. Heb. 13.56. Fears and doubtings, though they may be in believers, yet they argue want or weakneſs of faith, or of believing on him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.26. &amp; 14.31. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5, 6. This for the acts of this believing. But we have alſo in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The extent of the exerciſe of this faith; and that both,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For matters or caſes; and that is for all grace and bleſſing. <hi>The promiſes both of the life that is, and of that which is to come,</hi> being all <hi>in him; and in him, yea, and in him Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. with 1 Tim. 4.8. We are in our ſelves empty, and deſtitute of all things, and of all ability to help our ſelves in or unto any thing, poor, miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, wretched, blind, and naked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. Nor is there help any where elſe in any thing to purpoſe for us. He onely is the Saviour ordained and perfected of God for us; His merit, righteouſneſs, and worth onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures all; and he onely diſpenſes all by his Word, Spirit, and Divine Power and Providence: And in his way one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even in liſtening to his word, and obeying his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and commandments, all good and bleſſing is to be met with and received of us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For duration: And ſo in all this is included conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53764:96"/>
or perſeverance. For in theſe kind of ſpeeches that is implied: As when it is ſaid, <hi>He that believeth not is damned;</hi> or the <hi>wicked man ſhall dye;</hi> its meant, if they perſevere to do, or be ſo. So it's here: <hi>He that continueth to the end ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Matth. 24.13. <hi>He that abideth in him ſinneth not;</hi> that is, miſſes not the promiſed bleſſing, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6. But he that abideth not in him, is like a branch that abides not in the Vine; that withers, and is gathered, and is caſt into the fire and burned, <hi>John</hi> 15.5, 6. And thus much about that believing that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us, and is needful to our Salvation.</p>
               <p>Now that this believing is both required of us by, and is acceptable unto God, is alſo evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God requires it, theſe following Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, among divers others, make it evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that God calls to, and commands it. <hi>Look to me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth,</hi> Iſa. 45.22. And the ſame is implied in all thoſe calls and commands <hi>to make a joyful noiſe to the Lord,</hi> to <hi>ſerve him with gladneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 47.1. &amp; 62.1, 2. &amp; 98.4. &amp; 100.1, 2, 4. Yea, in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. it's expreſly ſaid, <hi>This is his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In that he hath <hi>given forth his word, and raiſed up a multitude of Preachers of it,</hi> Pſal. 68.11.

In his reproofs and judgments, (even to and upon the Heathen) for not <hi>calling on his name,</hi> (to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him is neceſſary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14:) it <hi>being excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in all the earth, and declared by his wondrous works,</hi> Pſal. 79.6. Jer. 10.25. Pſal. 8.1—9. &amp; 75.1. Mal. 1.11, 14. And for not <hi>glorifying him as God,</hi> nor being <hi>thankful to him,</hi> but <hi>withholding the truth in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> ſeeing <hi>what was to be known of God was manifeſted in them, and God ſhewed it to them;</hi> ſo as they <hi>knew,</hi> but <hi>liked not to have him in their knowledge,</hi> Rom. 1.18, 19, 20, 21—28. Yea, for <hi>not believing God,</hi> as now the Jews believe him not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.30. All imply, that God requires that men believe him, and believe on him, as made known to and among them. But much more evident is this, in his often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> among whom he was more ſignally made known, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1, 2. &amp; 147.19, 20.) in his faulting and judging them for not hearing and hearkening to his voice, law, and words, but rejecting them; and for not liking to have him for their God, the object of their ſtay, truſt, and confidence, but turning adulterouſly from him after others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5—13. &amp; 6.19. &amp; 7.25, 26. though uſing more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial means with, and towards them, (ſo as he vouchſafed not to any other Nation) to make them cleave to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.11.

               <p n="2">2. As for the acceptableneſs of it, his requiring it, and uſing or vouchſafing means and power for it, and his threatning and puniſhing men for not improving them thereto, and profiting by them; ſo as to practiſe it, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that alſo. But much more clearly is this evidenced to, and in them that believe.</p>

And if men have known ſomething of the Grace of God, and come to Chriſt in ſome meaſure; yet if they go not on to believe and exerciſe faith in him, they are in danger to be loſt, and periſh out of the way of truth and righteouſneſs: Every condition is likely to deſtroy them from it; as to ſay,</p>

As it's likely what counſel ſhe gave her Husband, ſhe would have her ſelf practiſed, had ſhe been in his caſe. <hi>Aſaph</hi> (or the Pen-man of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.) was in danger ſo to have done when he came to that in ver. 13, 14. <hi>Verily in vain have I cleanſed my heart, and waſhed my hands in innocency; for I have been plagued all the day long, and

So <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the day of temptation did in the wilderneſs; <hi>The word that they heard being not mixed with faith in them,</hi> nor they <hi>truſting on his ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 4.2. Pſal. 78.22, 23. &amp; 106.12, 13. Jude 5. For if the faith or believing on the Son of Man fail, then they fail of receiving his light, direction, ſtrength, or of the prevalency of the light and life given, ſo as not to walk aright in the way of God; and then they muſt needs turn out of it into crooked paths; as is implied in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. That they do who truſt not in the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 5. whereas if the faith or believing on the Son of God fails not, (for the faith, or that object of faith never fails any man that truſts to it) then he therein receives that <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and diſcretion</hi> that <hi>delivers him from the way of the evil man that walks in crooked paths, and from the way of the evil woman that flatters with her tongue;</hi> yea, ſuch <hi>underſtanding</hi> as cauſes <hi>to hate every falſe way,</hi> Prov. 2.10, 11, 12—15. &amp; Pſal. 119.104. And if a man ſhould through tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations get a fall in the way as <hi>Peter</hi> did, when through fear he denied his Maſter; yet he will get up again, and go on in his way, his faith not failing, as <hi>Peter</hi> did: for Chriſt will help him up again, to whom he looketh, and in whom he believeth; not imputing the weakneſſes of his believing, though reproving them: And ſo he ſhall go on in his way ſtill, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.30, 31.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God orders perſecutions for the Goſpel ſake to befall, unleſs the Son of Man be believed on, and looked to, and received in his inſtructions, counſels, and grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, a man will periſh from the way, from attending to, and walking with God in Chriſt in the way of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; for he will want ſtrength and courage to

But where the Son of Man is believed on with the heart, truſted to, and relied upon, he gives ſtrength and courage both againſt the fears and feelings of evil, and makes Conquerours over the world, and its frightfulleſt and ſharpeſt Perſecutions; as its ſaid, <hi>The Lord will give ſtrength to his people; the Lord will bleſs his people with peace,</hi> Pſal. 29.11. And <hi>this is our victory whereby we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, even our faith: Who is he that overcometh the world, [even</hi> the frowns and malice of the world] <hi>but he that believes that Jeſus is the Son of God?</hi> 1 John 5.3, 4. In this the Servants of God have been more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours over all adverſities: <hi>Neither tribulation, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, perſecution, famine, peril, nakedneſs, or ſword</hi> have been able <hi>to ſeparate them from the love of God that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> But for his ſake they have been, and have endured <hi>to be killed all the day long, and to be accounted as ſheep for the ſlaughter,</hi> Rom. 8.35, 36.

Women received their dead raiſed to life again: others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection.

They were ſtoned, ſawn aſunder tempted,</hi> [or as ſome render the word, burnt with hot Irons] <hi>They were ſlain with the ſword: they wandred about in ſheep-skins, and goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented: of whom the World was not worthy: they wandred about in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and mountains, in dens and caves of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. Such great things, both fears and tormenting afflictions, have they been ſtrengthned under, and preſerved from periſhing from the way by, through believing on the Son of Man. Whereof alſo we might add many pleaſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and inſtances (of Chriſtian fortitude, namely, through this faith) if we would rifle the writings of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, Socrates, Sozomen, Nicephorus</hi> and others, of the conſtancy of the Chriſtian Martyrs, and confeſſors in all ages, both under the <hi>Jewiſh, Heathen,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi> perſecutions; but I ſhall not be ſo tedious.</p>

Men have and ſhall be preſerved from periſhing from the way of the Lord, and helped to hold on their way with chearfulneſs and confidence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch diſcouragements. As <hi>through faith,</hi> not only <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the faithful, <hi>againſt hope believed in hope, according to what was ſaid to him.</hi> Rom. 4.18. But alſo <hi>Rahab the harlot periſhed not with them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not; but</hi> though an harlot, found favour and mercy, a Type and pattern of ſinners, through believing on the Son of man finding forgiveneſs, and heartned to walk on among Gods people to the injoyment of the heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did after their falls. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> and others, notwithſtanding what they ſee, and proved of the ſinfulneſs of their natures, which they often bewailed and complained of; as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.17, 18, 22. &amp; 51.1, 5, 15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14, 23, 24, 25.</p>

On the other hand, proſperity, riches, and fulneſs, often prove occaſions to turn men out of the way, and cauſe them to periſh from it, while their hearts are lifted up thereby into a forgetfulneſs of God; and into pride and high-mindedneſs; or are over-charged with the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

riches, and love of other things are choked, ſo as not to bring forth fruit to perfection.</hi> Mat. 13.7, 22. And againſt this our Saviour cautions his Diſciples, that <hi>their heart might not at any time be over-charged with ſurfetting, and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life, and that day come upon them unawares.</hi> Luk. 21.34, 35. The love of riches, honours, pleaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do often cauſe men to turn away from Chriſt to ſave them, and preſerve them: like the young man, who though very earneſt in running to Chriſt to know of him what he might do to have everlaſting life; yet when he heard, <hi>Sell all that thou haſt and give it to the poor and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me.</hi> Rather forſook Chriſt to keep his riches, then his riches to follow Chriſt, and obtain everlaſting life. <hi>Math.</hi> 19.16, 17, 21, 22. But now, where the Son of Man is believed on, prized, come to, depended and relied on, and his counſels entertained with ſure belief of them, as right and good; there a man is, and will be helped to look upon better riches, pleaſures, proſperity and honours, and in compare of them, to look upon theſe as empty and uncertain: and to judge Chriſt worthy the parting with them all for him, and truſting to him for his care and proviſion according to his promiſe, will notwithſtanding all threatnings of their loſs follow after him; and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him for the better, and more durable injoyments, behave himſelf as a Pilgrim in all theſe injoyments here. Thus we find, that though <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> had great riches, yet they periſhed not out of Gods way, by occaſion of them; but by faith in Chriſt, believing on him, kept his way and charge; and behaved themſelves in the midſt of their injoyments, <hi>as ſtrangers and Pilgrims in the Earth, declaring that they ſought another, even an heavenly Countrey.</hi> Gen. 13.2, 6. &amp; 24.35. &amp; 25.5. &amp; 26.12, 13, 14. &amp; 30 43. &amp; 32.10. With <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16. And <hi>Moſes,</hi> though brought up in <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:53764:102"/>
Court as the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter; yet <hi>through faith</hi> believing on the Son of Man, he was not ſnared ſo as to periſh from the way thereby; but <hi>refuſing to be called, the Son of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>daughter, choſe rather to ſuffer adverſity with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the reproches of Chriſt greater riches, then all the treaſures of</hi> Egypt: <hi>for he had reſpect to the recompence of reward.</hi> Heb. 11.24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In caſe of Gods giving honour, power, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to men, they are in a danger to (and often do) periſh from the way; either neglecting, and ſleighting, and ſo miſſing it; or if they were ſomewhat in it before, they wander out of it, not believing in the Son of Man to ſteer them evenly and uprightly in it; as is to be ſeen in many Kings and Princes that are, or have been corrupted, by power and greatneſs. Inſtances we have in <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Vzziah, Solomon,</hi> and other Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but now, if any ſuch believe on the Son of Man, and in God through him, he will preſerve them from periſhing from the way; as may be ſeen in <hi>David, Aſa, Jehoſaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> though they all had their ſtumbles and falls in the way: and this is that that is implyed in the ſecond <hi>Pſalme,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Be wiſe now therefore O ye Kings, underſtand</hi> (or be inſtructed) <hi>ye that Judge the Earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce before him with trembling. Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and ye periſh out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But then in adding, <hi>Bleſſed are all they that truſt in him.</hi> He implies, that they who do ſo in an exerciſe of faith, in, or believing on him, they ſhall be happy in this, that they ſhall be preſerved

from ſuch periſhing out of the way as befalls others that do not kiſs, or believe on him. I may alſo add,</p>
               <p n="6">6. In caſe of Gods honouring, and lifting up men with great ſpiritual gifts and favours, as knowledg, utterance, experience, and ſuch like priviledges. The heart not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing faith in the Son of Man, and living upon him as nothing in, and of itſelf notwithſtanding them; and as needing always to be found in him; upheld, and ſupplied by, and preſented in him, is in danger to periſh out of the way. As is implied in that counſel, and warning of the Apoſtles to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Rom. 11.20, 21. <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by faith, be not high-minded, but fear: for if God ſpared not the natural branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee.</hi> And as was exemplified in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Ezek. 16.16, 17, 18. That truſting in her own beauty and excellency, received from Chriſt her husband, and not living upon, and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to, and in him plai'd the harlot, and periſhed from the way; as is to be ſeen in the following verſes there: and in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7, 31. Whereas the living by the faith of the Son of God, and exerciſing it by believing on him, preſerves, and ſaves there-from; as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and all that in all ages lived by faith, in their injoyments of Gods gifts, favours, and priviledges, were. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In caſe of difficulties, and ſeeming hardneſs in the words, or works of God, or Chriſt, ſo as we cannot find them out, or comprehend them by our underſtanding, from want of believing on the Son of Man many periſh from the way of truth and righteouſneſs. So we find, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell in temptations and provocations, not <hi>knowing Gods way, erring in their hearts,</hi> through unbelief of his words, <hi>not mixed with faith in them.</hi> Pſal. 95.10. Heb. 3.15, 16, 18. with 4.2. When <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, followed God with a full heart, and were not

offended at any of his ways. <hi>Aſaph</hi> had like that way to have ſlipt, but that going <hi>into the Sanctuary of God</hi> through believing what he there met with, he was recovered. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> alſo, though he would reaſon with God of his judgments, yet holding faſt faith, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God was righteous in all his ways, was not in danger of miſcarrying. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1. Yea in a word, <hi>Great peace have they that love Gods Law, and nothing ſhall offend them,</hi> either in Gods words or works: for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>his word is right, and all his works are done in truth.</hi> Pſal. 119.165. with 33.4. That <hi>God is a Rock, his work perfect, and all his ways judgment; a God of truth and without iniquity: juſt and right is he,</hi> Deut. 32.4. But a moſt eminent inſtance of this we have in Chriſts Diſciples. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. where at a hard ſaying of his, about eating his Fleſh, and drinking his Blood, many of his Diſciples were ſo offended, that they periſhed from the way, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back from, and no more walking with Chriſt, and that becauſe they believed not; hung not upon him, as the Chriſt, tho Son of God, truſted not to his leading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what they could ſee and comprehend with their own underſtandings, as one they were perſwaded of, that he would not deceive or miſlead them. Whereas, <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; the other Apoſtles being asked, <hi>If that offended them alſo,</hi> and if <hi>they would go away too?</hi> replied, <hi>Whither ſhall we go? Thou haſt the words of eternal Life: and we know, and are ſure, that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the living God;</hi> and would not depart from him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.60, 61, 64, 67, 68, 69. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> alſo <hi>believing according to what was ſaid, and giving glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, ſtaggered not through unbelief,</hi> either at the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or greatneſs of what was promiſed; or at the unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of its being performed, and ſo turned not out of the way; however, he may be ſaid to have tripped in it, by liſtening to <hi>Sarahs</hi> advice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18.

Whereas, <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> (as is noted afore) not believing for the words ſake, nor for Gods ſake upon the account of his power and faithfulneſs, but judging by ſight and appearance, and accordingly believing, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting, turned aſide and periſhed from the way, many of them.</p>
               <p>And to ſay no more, in caſe of temptations, generally men not believing on Chriſt the Son of Man, and ſo on God, are in danger to periſh out of the way, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of their luſts, and of <hi>Sathan.</hi> And ſo all the diverſe ways of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> falling into ſin, and periſhing from the way, as by luſting after evil things, by Idolatry, by murmuring againſt Chriſt, by tempting Chriſt, and by fornication, mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. are reſolved gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally into their unbelief, as the grand root and cauſe of them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Jude</hi> 5.

There is indeed a periſhing in the end, in a ſence which may be of leſs miſchief, yea for mercy <hi>Viz.</hi> When men periſh in the end of their deſigns and undertakings, for that may be in order to their being led to Repentance: of ſuch a periſhing diverſe paſſages may be underſtood, in which the holy Ghoſt led his people, to pray againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; as <hi>Let the wicked periſh at the preſence of God,</hi> Pſal. 68.2. <hi>Let them be put to ſhame and periſh.</hi> Pſal. 83.17.

Indeed, it may ſeem that ſome that ſhall periſh in that great end of the World, the Day of the Lord, may not be quite periſhed from all hope till then, by that ſaying of our Saviour, That <hi>many ſhall ſay at that day, Lord, Lord, have we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Devils, and done many wonderful works; to whom he ſhall ſay, Depart from me, &amp;c.</hi> As if they ſhould plead at that day with ſome hope of finding mercy: but plain it is, that they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not on Chriſt, but live and dye in their unbelief, <hi>ſhall dye in their ſins.</hi> John 8.24. Their ſins unpardoned, and faſt bound upon them; and they bound over to ſuffer the puniſhment of them: and that in the final Judgment in Soul, and Body reunited. <hi>The fearful and unbelieving ſhall be caſt into the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death.</hi> An horrible end, decreed to the workers of iniquity; and ſuch as cannot be expreſſed: and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>What ſhall their end be, that obey not the Goſpel?</hi> As implying it to be unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably miſerable. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. But in none of theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall the believer on the Son of Man periſh; Neither, in that which is his hope and deſign as a believer, which is the glorifying of God, and the Salvation of his Soul.

               <p n="1">1. He ſhall be ſaved from periſhing from the way, by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his giving in light and truth, faithfully to direct him, and ſhew him the way that he ſhould go in. As it is ſaid, <hi>The meek will he guide in judgment; the meek will he teach his way.</hi> And <hi>what man is he that fears the Lord? him ſhall he teach the way that he ſhall chuſe, his Soul ſhall dwell at eaſe (or lodge in goodneſs)</hi> ſhall not fall into ſnares and miſchiefs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.8, 12, 13, 14. And in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, who is Gods Servant, upon whom he hath put his Spirit, to bring forth Judgment: He, that is Chriſt, will not fail to teach him, and to bring forth Judgment into truth, or victory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 3, 4. Chriſt being <hi>come a Light into the world, that whoſoever believeth on him, ſhould

not abide in darkneſs, but ſee the light of Life,</hi> John 8.12. And his word being believed, and abid in (as it is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on the Son of man) keeps from ſinning againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. Yea, it cleanſeth their way, and makes it more perfect, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. And ſo gives a continuance in the Father and in the Son, both in dependance on them; and in their favour and protection from what might harm them, whether it be the World, or any Antichriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or Doctrine, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.24. And that becauſe Chriſt alſo therein, and there-with</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Yea, his <hi>words are Spirit and Life,</hi> John 6.63. And he hath promiſed that they that <hi>believe on him as the Scripture hath ſaid,</hi> to them he will <hi>give,</hi> ſo as they ſhall <hi>receive his holy Spirit,</hi> Joh. 7.37, 38, 39. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.32. We have not now his bleſſed Body of Fleſh, to ſee and converſe with ſenſibly, or to ſhew, and teſtifie our love to, as his Diſciples, and <hi>Mary</hi> had: but inſtead thereof, he hath left us his words, and therein his mind and Commandment; and we may ſhew love to him therein: though we cannot anoint his head, kiſs his feet, take his body in our armes (which his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might do, and one that pretended love to him in ſome ſuch actions, betrayed him) yet we have that in which we may teſtifie love, even his word, we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to him in that, hear him, and hugg him too, as it were therein; take that and lay it up in our hearts keep it in our breaſts and diligently obſerve, and follow it. And <hi>he that hath his Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him: and he that loveth him, ſhall be loved both of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, and of him;</hi> and he <hi>will manifeſt his own ſelf to him, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father for them;</hi> and <hi>ſending his holy Spirit to lead,

and guide them into all truth;</hi> and <hi>abide with them for ever,</hi> John 14.15, 16, 17, 21. And he will ſo <hi>glorifie Chriſt</hi> to the Soul, and <hi>ſhew it things to come,</hi> as to make afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and perſecutions light and bearable to it, and give it peace and comfort in them; and carry them above, and keep them from being harmed, by the proſperity and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of this World, or by any baits or temptations.

He preſerves them, by mediating with God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from them, that the weakneſſes and infirmities; and through infirmity, neglects and wanderings from him being ſeen, confeſſed, and turned from, might not be imputed, to hinder or with-hold his grace and Spirit from being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth to lead, inſtruſt, reprove, reduce, comfort, and work the works of God in them, till it perfect what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7, 25.

A continual living in a ſtate of forgiveneſs and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, which is a truly joyful and happy ſtate, in which the Soul hath cauſe of real joy and gladneſs; as it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered; Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin.</hi> Pſal. 32.1, 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man who knows the joyful ſound.</hi> Pſal. 89.15. <hi>And happy is the man who hath the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>for his help, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 146.5, 6. A ſtate in which the Soul is <hi>paſſed from death to life, and ſhall not come into condemnation.</hi> Joh. 5.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A continual in dwelling of the the Spirit of Life, as a Spring of Spiritual Life and motion toward God, and for him, even the Spirit of God, which is <hi>the Spirit of life,</hi> and the operation and efficacy of him in the Soul (though not always ſenſibly felt here) as it is ſaid, <hi>He that drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, it ſtall be in him a Spring of living waters ſpringing up in him unto Etetnal life,</hi> Joh, 4.14. So as this Spring ſhall never fail him that believeth

going on and continuing to believe on the Son of man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A continual ſtate of ſafety from all evil, ſo as to its being deſtructive or hurtful to the Soul, or in due time affective, and a ſtate of Title to, and Intereſt in, yea and injoyment of all that is good, in a firſt-fruits, and by Spirit here, and fully and actually, and for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after there <hi>ſhall no evil happen to the juſt.</hi> Prov. 12.21. <hi>All things are the believers,</hi> 1 Cor 3.21. <hi>And all things ſhall work together for his good.</hi> Rom. 8.28. Pſal. 25.10. <hi>The Lord God is a Son and a Shield, and he will give grace and glory, and with-hold no good thing,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 84.11.</p>
               <p n="4">4, Nor ſhall this happy ſtate be ever taken from him; but though through workings of the fleſh, a man may not be always ſenſible of theſe things, nor have always actual rejoycing while here; yet his ſtate is always ſuch, and ſhall hereafter appear, and be moſt ſenſibly and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch; for this life here begun by Chriſt and by his Spirit, never ſhall terminate or end, but increaſe, and be more full as to the injoyment and perception of it in the abiding believer on the Son of Man, till it be moſt immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably perfect. <hi>They that ſeek God ſhall Praiſe him, their hearts ſhall live for ever.</hi> Pſal. 22.26. Death ſhall not put an end to this life; when the body dies, the man even then ſhall be in a living ſtate of the Spirit or inner man, in a truly happy and joyful condition, though it appear not upon the body of man, or to the view of the natural man, much leſs ſhall it terminate after death to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit made perfect; for it being with Chriſt, ſhall be in a better ſtate then while here. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21, 23. <hi>To be diſſolvd and to be with Chriſt is far better</hi> then to be here; much leſs ſhall this life ceaſe, fail or terminate in the ſtate of the reſurrection; for that ſtate is moſt properly and fully called <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Mark 10.30. <hi>In the world to come Eternal life;</hi> becauſe then neither Soul nor Body ſhall die any more; but then,</p>

                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:53764:110"/>1. The body ſhall be in an eternally, unchangeably happy and bleſſed ſtate of life, a glorious body, <hi>like the glorious body of Christ.</hi> Phil. 3.20.

               <p n="2">2, The Soul and inward man ſhall be perfect in its knowledge of, conformity to, and joy in God, and in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; For <hi>then we ſhall ſee as we are ſeen, know as we are known: Then that which is perfect being come, that which is in part ſhall be done away.</hi> 1 Cor. 13.10, 12. Then we ſhall have <hi>fulneſs of joy in Gods preſence, and pleaſures at Gods right hand for evermore.</hi> Pſal. 16.12. 1 Joh. 3.2. There ſhall then be no more ignorance or envy, nor ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor care, nor whatever may render the Soul in the leaſt defective in its happineſs; but the favour of God and of the Lamb as a clear River of pure waters, pure and immixed, and never failing, ſhall fill it perpetually with all Heavenly and Spiritual fruitfulneſs in every good thing. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4, 11. &amp; and 22.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9.13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.23.

               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of their way they have and ſhall have it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Through ſufferings and death, even as our Lord Chriſt himſelf that way entred into his glory. <hi>It is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying</hi> (or the word is faithful) <hi>for if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; And if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo Reign with him; If we, even we,</hi> who at preſent believe in him, <hi>deny him, he will alſo deny us.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>Through much affliction we muſt enter into Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Acts 14.22. No partaking of this life but through death, and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Through a Spiritual Death, or death in and of our Spirits to falſe life, as to the life of or in ſin; life to the world, and to the Law, as thinking to have life thereby,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53764:111"/>
as in our own righteouſneſs according thereunto. No living to righteouſneſs, and to God, but in dying to ſin, and to the world; ſo as to ceaſe to be ſlaves or ſervants to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.10, 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. nor is there any living to Chriſt and ſo to God, but through dying to the Law, as to our hopes and rejoycings in our own righteouſneſs according thereunto, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. And in theſe kinds of deaths there are pains in ſelf-denials: taking up our croſs for Chriſts ſake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Through the bodily Death; for neither is there any entring into the joys and glories of Heaven, and of the life to come, ſo as to the actual full fruition of them but through bodily Death and Grave (except of ſuch as ſhall be found alive at his appearing, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.15, 16.) that ſo we may be made <hi>conformable to the death</hi> of Chriſt, and be <hi>planted</hi> therethrough <hi>into the likeneſs of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in our body alſo. For the way to this life is alſo,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Through the Reſurrection from the dead; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if we ſhould dye in our ſelves to falſe lives, and never riſe up in a true and divine life, we could not have eternal life. The life of Chriſt is a life from the dead, whence he is called <hi>the firſt begotten, or firſt-born from the dead,</hi> Col. 1.18. Rev. 1.5. and ſo all that ſhare with him therein, are raiſed up to a life from the dead too. Firſt, raiſed up in their ſpirits with him <hi>through the faith of the operation of God,</hi> Col. 2.12. &amp; 3.1. <hi>crucified with Chriſt</hi> to ſelf, and fleſh, and ſin, and all falſe life; but yet ſo as they <hi>live: yet not they, but Chriſt liveth in them,</hi> Gal. 2.20. And then alſo at the great day of Chriſts glorious appearing, their dead bodies ſhall be raiſed up by him, and be made like his. Thence the Reſurrection ſaid to be <hi>to thoſe that have done good a Reſurrection to Life,</hi> Joh. 5.28, 29. and Chriſt in telling us that they who believe on him ſhall have everlaſting life; once and again adds, <hi>And I
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53764:112"/>
will raiſe him up at the laſt day,</hi> Joh. 6.40.44. as imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they muſt paſs through death, and be raiſed up again thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the manner of their having it, they have it as they have Chriſt himſelf who is their life, the ground, foundation, authour, and the fountain of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3, 4. and ſo only in receiving, abiding in, and enjoyment of him, and ſo</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have it here in a ſenſe, not in the fulneſs and perfection of the fruition of it; for we are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of having it ſo now, and here while we have not Chriſt in Perſon with us: but they have it now,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Chriſt the Heir of it, and the root and ſpring of it, <hi>that eternal life that was with the Father, and was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.2. &amp; 5.11, 12, 13. as they have him theirs, and have union with, and intereſt in him; through whom alſo they have it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In a firſt fruits of the Spirit, and of the Life that is in and by it, and ſo in a begun life or happy ſtate of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, acceptance, ſpiritual quickning, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> as before ſaid,</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the promiſe of the whole, even of the full fruition of it to be had hereafter. God and Chriſt have given it them in his Will and Teſtament, ſo as in believing on the Son of Man, they are <hi>made Heirs of it,</hi> Tit, 1.2. &amp; 3.7. 1 Joh. 2.25. <hi>This is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even eternal life,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.25, See alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. And ſo they have it</p>
               <p n="4">4. In <hi>the hope</hi> of it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. 1 Pet. 1, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the ſtate to come they ſhall have it,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon their diſſolution and going to Chriſt, in their ſpirits more fully; reſting in and with Chriſt, and being <hi>bleſſed,</hi> Phil. 1.21.23. Rev. 14.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon their Reſurrection, in the full; perfect, and perpetual poſſeſſion and fruition of it for ever, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53764:112"/>
A portion infinitely deſirable, and worthy the looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and yet this is the portion of every one that believ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth on the Son of Man, without exception. No reſpect of perſons, no difference of ſtronger or weaker believer, as to the future enjoyment or preſent right to, and intereſt in it by and through Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>There is neither Male nor Female, Jew nor Greek, Circumciſion nor Uncircumciſion, bond or free; but all are one in Chriſt Jeſus: and if Chriſts, then Abrahams Seed and Heirs according to promiſe,</hi> Gal. 3.28, 29. And yet in the rewards to be received in the Davidical Kingdom, or the thouſand years reign at the coming of Chriſt, and before <hi>he deliver up the Kingdom to God the Father, and God be all in all,</hi> there will doubtleſs be different degrees of Glory and Honour conferred according to mens different works, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, faithfulneſs and fruitfulneſs in their ſervices, and greatneſs of their ſufferings for him; as is hinted in thoſe parabolical paſſages: <hi>Be thou Ruler over ten Cities, be thou Ruler over five,</hi> Luc. 19.17, 19. otherwiſe it would be all one to ſerve Chriſt little or much here, to be abundant or ſparing in the work of the Lord, contrary to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He that ſoweth liberally ſhall reap libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: and he that ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.6. Though yet a ſhorter work more ſingly done may have equal reward with a larger not ſo ſingly done; as the Parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. may ſeem to import.

                  <p> The application of the two former, <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth and fifth Obſervations in part in exhortation to believe reproof for not believing, incouragements to continue in believing on the Son of Man; and ſome directions thereto.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE conſideration of the two laſt mentioned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, ſhewing the neceſſity and advantage of believing on the Son of Man, as alſo the nature of this believing, is and may be very uſeful upon diverſe accounts. As to</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Exhort and preſs all men to believe on the Son of Man, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as declared and ſet forth unto them in and by the diſcoveries, teaching and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God and his Spirit vouchſafed to them. And that they may believe on him to liſten to, mind and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and hold faſt the Faith or Doctrine of him, in which is the power, ſpirit, and hand of the Lord moving and enabling to believe: yea begetting in the heart this faith that is ſo neceſſary and profitable for men: For <hi>ſaith is of hearing, and hearing is of the word of God;</hi> not of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hearing, nor of every word, but of hearing the word of God. From which word, hearing, or the hearing Ear alſo is effected and proceeds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. For <hi>no man can come unto Chriſt,</hi> this Son of Man, <hi>unleſs it be given to him of God, unleſs he draws him;</hi> and he draws by his teaching men the knowledge of him; whence it is ſaid, <hi>every one that heareth and learneth of the Father comes unto him,</hi> Joh. 6.44, 45, 65. It is <hi>of his own good will that he begets men through the word of truth, to be</hi> (of a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible vile, worthleſs creature as man hath made himſelf by his ſin) <hi>a kind of firſt-fruits of his creatures</hi> (a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53764:113"/>
and prime creature to him, a new creature, a firſt-fruits of his future new creation) <hi>therefore</hi> it behooves men, every one to be <hi>ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak, ſlow to wrath, ſlow to</hi> murmur and be angry at the word of truth, and the inſtructions, reproofs and counſels of it, becauſe claſhing with the wiſdom and will of the fleſh, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, thoughts and practices of the world, and of the wiſe men thereof: but <hi>with meekneſs to receive the ingraffed word</hi> (the word as God puts and ingraffs it into the heart) <hi>which is able to ſave the Soul, being not only hearers of the word, but doers of it</hi> as it is working (and ſo God in and with it) <hi>to will and to do of good pleaſure,</hi> Jam. 1.18, 19, 21. Phil. 2.12, 13. turning at Gods reproofs therein given; from whatſoever in conceit, apprehenſion or opinion we hold or imagine that claſhes with the truth diſcovered in the word and its inſtructions; that we may ſo conceive, judge and believe as that declares and informs us of all things; and from whatſoever in affection, deſire, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or practice we naturally or through evil principles or cuſtoms affect, deſire, purpoſe or practice diſagreeing with, and reproved by the light and inſtruction of that bleſſed word; that ſo we may obey its counſel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and affect, deſire, purpoſe and practice what it commends and leads us to ſeeking after that, and ſo the wiſdom of God will <hi>pour out his ſpirit to us, and make known his words,</hi> Prov. 1.22, 23. and ſo <hi>hearing, the Soul ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55.3. there through attaining to <hi>know the name of the Lord,</hi> the Son of Man, we ſhall be ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, framed and have the will ſet to <hi>truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. in meditating in the law and doctrine of the Lord, and exerciſing our ſelves in it day and night, the heart will be fixed to truſt in the Lord, and to make him its hope: Yea, and therein to be rooted, grounded and fixed like a Tree planted by the water ſide:
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53764:114"/>
ſo as to abide in the blaſts of temptations, and be <hi>fruitful in every good work, increaſing in the knowledge of God, ſtrengthened with all might according to his glorious power to all patience and long ſuffering with joyfulneſs,</hi> Pſal. 1.1, 2, 3. Jer. 17.7, 8. Col. 1.10, 11. for <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt (the preaching of the croſs) is the power of God to ſalvation</hi> (even from unbelief, and all the power of darkneſs) <hi>to every one that believes it,</hi> Rom. 1.16. 1 Cor. 1.22, 23. So as that in taking diligent heed thereto, and yeilding up our ſelves to the power that worketh therein, we ſhall be helped and framed to believe on the Son of God; its <hi>through his name</hi> that men receive power to believe on him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. and therefore it behooves all men (as they would avoid the periſhing from Gods way, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery and deſtruction at the end; and as they would obtain the everlaſting life and happineſs propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and promiſed) to give ſerious and diligent heed and obedience thereto; who would willingly incur pain, grief and affliction here, or to periſh by hunger, cold, priſon, gallows or the like; and yet theſe things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſhort of the evil of periſhing from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power for ever: Yea, who that is travelling to ſome remote place; where if he go right on to it, he ſhall find great riches, honours or gain, would be willing, or through carefulneſs expoſe himſelf to looſe, and be loſt out of the way, and to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a Wilderneſs among bryers, and thorns, boggs, and lakes; yea among wild and ſavage creatures, as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, lyons, tygers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when in a diligent careful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after, and attendance to ſome faithful direction and guide, he might go right and ſafe, and attain the good propoſed, and miſs that periſhing by hunger, cold, the teeth of the wild beaſts that he is otherwiſe in danger off! and yet that periſhing from the way, and danger of final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53764:114"/>
periſhing by the ways or means forementioned, are little evils in compariſon of periſhing from Gods way, and by what that periſhing expoſes to! who again that hath proffer and opportunity of being made rich, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, living pleaſantly and delightfully for a long time (ſo long ſuppoſe, as was the life of <hi>Methuſelah</hi>) would willingly refuſe and looſe ſuch enjoyments, and incur an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable miſeries! and yet this eternal life which God hath promiſed to give to them that believe on, and follow after the Son of Man, is infinitely more excellent then all the honours, riches, pleaſures, and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent enjoyments of this world, though they might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſafely, not only ſo long as the life of <hi>Methuſalah;</hi> but alſo ſo long as from the beginning of this world to the end thereof, without interruption. Oh therefore how concerns it all men to come and believe on the Son of Man; and to that purpoſe to liſten to, and receive the teachings of God concerning him, that ſuch miſeries may be miſſed, and ſuch mercies enjoyed; that they may not periſh in the way, and from the end, but may have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life!</p>

How doth this then reprove the vanity, folly, pride and wickedneſs of the world, which rejects and puts from them, and matter not to believe on this moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent one whom God to ſuch glorious ends hath raiſed up for us? If it be folly and madneſs in men, who may in hearing their Fathers and freinds good inſtructions in matters of this world; live well and comfortably; have and get yet more of the good things of this world, to maintain them and preſerve them from want and beggery, and make them live in credit and repute; to turn their backs upon ſuch good counſels, and thereby willingly and wilfully through their pride, folly, ſlothfulneſs, love of bad company, or the like, bring themſelves into debt,

poverty, priſons; and nothing but a Series of miſeries! How much more is it folly and madneſs for the world, or any of us to neglect Gods word, and Gods Son, and that great Salvation wrought and preached, and brought to us by ſo great and glorious a hand, as that of this Son of Man, being alſo the Son of God, the mighty God and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and thereby to deprive our ſelves of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable bliſs and happineſs as cannot be conceived, and plunge our ſelves into ſuch miſeries as cannot be imagined? And yet evident it is that ſuch folly and madneſs the world is greatly guilty of: For evident it is that it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally rejects and treads under foot the Lord Jeſus, and the doctrine that declares him, and is left to us by him, in which is included our ſalvation and happineſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46, 47. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.13.

to all the evil that the unbeliever may fall into.

For if we ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully after the knowledge of the truth received, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin: but a certain fearfull looking for, of fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſary.

We have to encourage us to this believing and holding faſt the faith, all the Trinity for us, God the Father gave his Son to that end that we might believe on him, and be ſaved, and live for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. And he fills, ſtrengthens and upholds his Son in, and unto all his undertakings for us, in order to the bringing us to that ſafety and eternal life and happineſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 5, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.20, 21, 22.

Heb. 6.13. And if we believe men upon their ſolemn oaths, ſhall we not much more believe God, when to confirm our faith he adds his oath to his promiſe, ingaging himſelf thereby to the performance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have manifold evidences of Gods truth, and the truth of his Word, in which theſe things are covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and promiſed: all that evidences Gods truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in making good his words, increaſes this aſſurance; and that's much, as, the caſting off the Jews for their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and unbelief, according to what, or ſo far as, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets long ſince fore-ſignified. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.17, 18. &amp; 32.21, 22. &amp; 30.1. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, &amp; 10, &amp; 11.11. The calling and bringing in us Gentiles to be his people, which was propheſied off long before, while we were all worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Idols and Devils. Yet God hath made good this againſt all appearing probability; even then, when that one Nation that had the Oracles of God, and boaſted themſelves to be his people, and to have him for their God, and he a greater God than all the gods of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; was for their ſins rejected, ſo as to have their City ſackt and burnt, their Land laid waſt, their people deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by famine, peſtilence, ſword, and led captive into all lands, and that by thoſe who oppoſed the Lord, his word, and ways; and were ready to attribute all their ſucceſſes to the ſtrength of their Gods or Idols, and the ruine of their enemies to the weakneſs of their God. <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.23, 24. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.33. and 19.22. Yet even then by the preaching of the Apoſtles, a few deſpiſed perſons, he got himſelf the victory over them, and brought in the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles againſt all the malice of the Devils and thier worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers

               <p n="1">1. By taking an external profeſſion of the faith, or of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in God, and on Jeſus Chriſt his Son, for a real and hearty believing on him.

               <p n="2">2. By taking every ſuch profeſſion of the faith of him, and of believing on him, as in which men preach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him, and find ſome good effects follow thereupon among men, to be the believing on him here ſpoken of. <hi>Whereas, many ſhall ſay in that day,</hi> when Chriſt comes, <hi>Have we not preached in thy name, and in thy name caſt out devils, and done many wonderful works?</hi> To whom yet Chriſt ſhall ſay <hi>and profeſſe, I never knew you, depart from me ye workers of iniquity.</hi> Matth. 7.22, 23.

Many in whom their zeal, and frames and works ſpring not from faith in Chriſt, but from other principles, as a deſire to be ſaved, with a thought that they muſt be ſo upon the merit or account of their own good works, as is to be ſeen among many Papiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and ſuch may be ſaid to be <hi>of works,</hi> rather then <hi>of faith,</hi> and ſo far from being heirs of eternal life, that they are <hi>under the curſe,</hi> Gal. 3.10, 11, 12.

               <p>How that was, we have in ſome meaſure ſeen, &amp; by whom He is, and is to be ſo lifted up, that which remains here to be conſidered, is, that it's neceſſary and behoveful that he be ſo lifted up both with reference to mens believing on him as the next end of it: and with reference to their not periſhing, but having eternal life who believe on him and in their believing on him; which is the laſt and Ultimate end, and to demonſtrate this, I ſhall briefly lay down and prove two or three concluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſion</hi> 1. That the lifting him up both by men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53764:127"/>
the croſs, as ordered of God, and by God himſelf in his uniting the nature of man in him to the eternal word and his calling him forth to, upholding him in, raiſing him out of, and rewarding and glorifying him at his right hand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ſufferings was of abſolute neceſſity both as to mens believing on him; and as to their being ſaved from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having life eternal, in believing on him. In which concluſion be two branches:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch.</hi> 1. That this lifting him up was neceſſary to mens believing on him, and that is clear, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he could not have been an Object to be believed on, for any of thoſe things which we need, in order to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and ever-living. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Had he not been made one with the Word, the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> made the Son of God, he had been but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo not meet to be believed on with a divine faith or dependance on him, either for procuring for us, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring on us the things pertaining to ſalvation and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, no meer creature being ſo to be believed on by us, or able to ſave us; nor had he been ſuch a one as had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the propheſies foregoing, concerning the perſon in whom we are directed to have our truſt, For he in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies is deſcribed to be the Son of God. <hi>I wil declaree the decree, the Lord hath ſaid unto me, thou art my Son; this day have begotten thee.</hi> Pſal. 2.6. <hi>And this Son is he of whom its is ſaid, Kiſs the ſon leſt he be angry, and bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi> verſ. 11, 12. <hi>The Son given,</hi> is He that is <hi>the mighty God.</hi> Iſai. 9.6. and if he were not ſo, he ſhould be looked upon but as a meer creature, and ſo as a meer medium by whom and by which God extends his mercy and goodneſs, and not as the extender and procurer of it; we are counſelled and ſometimes people have been commended for believing the Prophets of the Lord, who were but men indued with the ſpirit, or gifts of the ſpirit
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53764:127"/>
of the Lord. As it is ſaid, <hi>Believe his Prophets, ſo ſhall ye proſper.</hi> 2 Chron. 20.20. <hi>And they believed God and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> Moſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.31. But not any where to believe on any man that's a meer man, but always in or on the <hi>Lord Jehovah.</hi> As in the ſame 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.20. Where he ſaith <hi>Believe his Prophets.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Believe in</hi> (or on) <hi>the Lord your God,</hi> but not believe on his Prophets. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Chriſt the Son of man were not alſo the Son of God, and God <hi>Jehovah,</hi> he were not a lawfull object to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in, or relyed and depended on, for procuring or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring ſafety and eternal life; nay, nor for the mercies of this life; much leſs thoſe which are of that nature, that it's not poſſible for any that is but a creature, to procure or confer. But we are bid and commanded to believe on the ſon of man, Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Believe in God, believe alſo on me.</hi> Joh. 14.1. <hi>And this is his commandement, that ye believe on the name of the only begotten Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Had he not been lifted up by men upon the Croſs as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to appointed of God, and ſo called forth to, &amp; ſupported un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſufferings for us, he had ſtill not been an object to be believed on for life and ſalvation as the ſon of man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there could have been none in him for us, but we had been left under the neceſſity of periſhing for ever; the law of God being broken by us, and the ſentence and curſe of it therethrough falling upon us, &amp; we naked and open there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Under the Law, the figure of heavenly things, there was <hi>ſcarce any thing purged but by blood, and without ſhedding of blood was no remiſſion.</hi> Heb. 9.22. Shadowing and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the neceſſity of the death of a ſacrifice for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from under the wrath of God, and for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſins. But no ſacrifice of the law could make an expiation, becauſe of the weakneſs and unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them <hi>For it was not poſſible for the blood of Bulls and Goats to take away ſin;</hi> wherefore God rejected them, when
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53764:128"/>
it was ſaid, <hi>Sacrifice and Offerings thou wouldſt not have, but a body haſt thou prepared for me.</hi> Heb. 5.6. Which was ſpoken prophetically of Chriſt the Son of God, becoming the ſon of man; ſignifying the neceſſity and certainty of his being made a ſacrifice and ſhedding his precious blood for us, to make atonement for us And indeed if our ſins could have been purged or expiated, and redemption ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without the death of Chriſt for us, and his bearing, and therein and thereby making ſatisfaction for our ſins, then would his death and ſufferings be rendred vain and needleſſe, which is horrible for us to think that God would put his own and only begotten ſon to ſuch agonies, ſorrows and death without need for them: as the Apoſtle implies, when he ſaith, <hi>I do not fruſtrate the grace of God; for if righteouſneſs be by the law, then Chriſt dyed in vain,</hi> that is needleſly. The end of his dying might have been brought about without it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. Some rich man might have redeemed his brother by buying and giving to God a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thoſe legal ſacrifices for him, contrary to <hi>Pſal</hi> 49.6, 7, 8. Yea, and the Apoſtle by ſaying, if righteouſneſs be by the law, excludes righteouſneſs by any other means than by the death of Chriſt. Taking it for granted, that the law was the moſt abſolute way for getting righteouſneſs, that ever was in the World, beſides the death and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt; it containing precepts and appointments ordered of God: and if that was inſufficient, ſurely all the riches and honours in the World could not procure it; nor any doctrines or documents of the Phyloſophers or wiſe men of the Gentiles, or of any people whatſoever; they being far ſhort of God and his wiſdome, in appointing things pleaſing in his ſight; ſo that it follows that there was a neceſſity of Chriſts death, and of his being lifted up in ſuch ſenſe as we ſhewed before that he was exalted and lifted up therein; becauſe otherwiſe he could not have been an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53764:128"/>
to be looked to, or beleived on, for ſalvation; becauſe no ſalvation or redemption from death and curſe, and by conſequence no eternal life, or lawfull power to give it, could have been in him but by his death and ſufferings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neceſſary hereto alſo it was, that he ſhould not himſelf periſh in his ſufferings, as to his humanity, but be raiſed up again; otherwiſe he could be no object ſtill to be believed on for life and ſalvation. Becauſe, had he not riſen again from the dead, but been loſt and periſhed, therein he could not have been as the Son of man in any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of helping us; nor could we have been juſtified and acquitted from our ſins by his ſufferings; ſeeing his body in which he bare our ſins was the payment given to law and juſtice for them; and had not that been raiſed, the debt had not been acknowledged as ſufficiently paid, or to have been ſufficient to ſatisfie juſtice. Yea, he being our Champion, had he periſhed in the conflict or combate, and not returned Victor, we had all been routed: as it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Philiſtines, when <hi>Goliah</hi> was ſlain by <hi>David;</hi> or rather as it would have fared with <hi>Iſrael</hi> had <hi>Goliah</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>David. If Chriſt be not riſen, preaching is vain; and our faith is vain, we are yet in our ſins.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14.17. Nor could he as the Son of man have been in a caſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive or help us any further, much leſſe to keep us back from periſhing and give us eternal life. For from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dead, while dead, what help can be expected?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor could he be an Object to be believed on, or we have had any ground to believe on him for procuring for us further grace or diſpenſing it to us for preſerving us from periſhing in the ſecond death; or for directing &amp; lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in the way to, or bringing us to the injoyment of eternal life, if he had been only raiſed to live as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon, or in a mean condition as before on the earth again, without being exalted to Gods right hand, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53764:129"/>
in the nature of man, and as the Son of man with thoſe Offices of the great Prophet and Apoſtle, and High-Prieſt of our profeſſion; the great King of Saints and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Lord of all creatures. If he had not been glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the glory of God, and filled with his fulneſſe. <hi>If he had been here on earth ſtill, he ſhould not have been a Prieſt, ſeeing there were Prieſts that offer gifts according to the Law.</hi> Heb. 8. Nor would <hi>the comforter have been ſent to</hi> his Apoſtles and ſervants, ſeeing it behooved him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf to God as the perfect ſacrifice, and become the great High-Prieſt, even in <hi>the Heavens themſelves, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the preſence of God for us, and making interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for tranſgreſſors, and for all that come to God by him;</hi> that he might <hi>purge the Heavens themſelves</hi> from the effects and cries of our ſins there: and ſprinkling the vertues of his precious blood there, in the preſence of God, make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and obtain and receive the holy ſpirit for us to ſhed forth upon us, and to remove the guilt of our ſins from before God, that it might be diſpenſed to us to lead us into his truth. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7. &amp; 14, 16, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24, 25, 26. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. And ſo as the great Lord and King command deliverances, honours and bleſſings to us, we could not have him as an Object to look to, to forgive us our ſins, to give us the holy ſpirit to ſupport our ſpirits, renew our natures, guide us to death, raiſe us up from death and give us the Kingdom; if he were not impowered to do all theſe things, and all things elſe for us, our faith in him for all theſe things would be otherwiſe in vain. But now being in all things before-mentioned lifted up; made the Son of God in the nature of man, delivered up to death for our ſins, as a ranſom and attonement for us; and therein ſupported and accepted, and therefrom raiſed and revived, exalted to Gods right hand, and there glorified. He is a compleat Object of faith to be believed on; being every
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53764:129"/>
way able to help and ſave us. One, who in his death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection hath delivered us from periſhing in the firſt death or judgment for the firſt offence, and as exalted at Gods right hand, able to ſave us alſo from the wrath to come, and ſo from the ſecond Death, (and ſo he will all that come to God by him) through his exerciſe of his glorious Office of High Prieſt with God for us, and of his Prophetical and Kingly Offices towards all men, and eſpecially thoſe that believe, and of his Lordly authority over all Creatures in Heaven, Earth and Hell, for our behoof and benefit, and to give Eternal Life to all of us that believe on him, being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo both willing and faithful, as his ready underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings and ſufferings of ſuch things for us, evince; and as his glorious Offices to ſuch purpoſes put upon him, and received by him in a ſenſe enjoyne or require of him.</p>
               <p>I might add hereto, that as all this exaltation, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Son of Man, was neceſſary to render him an Object to be believed on: So was it alſo neceſſary for the diſcovering him to be ſuch an Object, which is neceſſary alſo to the begetting belief on him; for God being true, and one that could not lie, could not, nor would not have diſcovered that as an Object to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on that were not ſuch, his making peace was the ground as well as the matter of his preaching, in preaching, Peace. Nor could there therefore have been any ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Spirit with ſuch a diſcovery, to inable and move to believe it. His perſonal lifting up in thoſe ways and particular, being the foundation of all the reſt; nothing of the reſt could have been without that; but I only hint it, and paſs to the ſecond Branch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:53764:130"/>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 2. That his being ſo lifted up and exalted in thoſe real Acts done to himſelf, as is before mentioned, was neceſſary for his ſaving us from periſhing, and for his giving us Eternal Life in believing on him, and this is evidenced both in what is ſaid before in the fifth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation about the way of his ſaving us from periſhing, and our having Eternal Life, and alſo in what is ſaid on the former Branch. And indeed this evinces it in general, and as to all the particulars included therein, that that being Gods <hi>grand deſign</hi> in giving him, as the next Verſes ſhew; <hi>[God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life; for God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him mtght be ſaved]</hi> yea, and of his lifting him up, as this Verſe ſaith, <hi>[That whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have Eternal Life]</hi> it follows, that either theſe things before mentioned, were neceſſary to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and done to him to thoſe ends, or elſe thoſe ends might have been otherwiſe brought about; and ſo they were ordered and done to him needleſly, and in vain; which would impoſe upon the infinite wiſdom or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and imply that which neither may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nor conceded or granted; <hi>For if there had</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>been a Law</hi> (and by conſequence any other way) <hi>that could have given life, doubtleſs Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by it.</hi> Gal. 3.21. But beſides, that all theſe things were neceſſary to be ordered and done to him for his ſaving us from periſhing, and giving us Eternal Life, may be ſeen alſo by induction.</p>
               <p>For his being taken into unity of perſon in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature that was neceſſary to his ſaving us from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in the firſt Death; for otherwiſe his power and ability, his worth and excellency would have been too
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53764:130"/>
ſmall to have done and ſuffered what was needful for our Redemption therefrom, and for Gods acceptance as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient thereunto. It was the work of an Infinite and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtrength, ſuch as the finiteneſs of a Creature, or meer man could not reach unto, to ſtand under, and bear upon himſelf the weight of mans Sin and Death, and by bearing to overcome them, and to ſatisfie Gods juſtice for the ſin, and aboliſh the death, required a Sacrifice of an infinite merit and worth, no meer man had either ſtrength or worth enough for ſuch a thing, not ſtrength to endure and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch agonies and death; nor worth to be taken for a ſufficient ranſom or price of Redemption for all men, no nor for any one man; for <hi>no man</hi> (that is but a man) <hi>can give to God a ranſom for his Brother, a price to God ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for him, that he may not ſee death.</hi> Pſal. 49.6, 7, 8. <hi>But the Lord (Jehovah,</hi> He that is God alſo) <hi>will Redeem my Soul,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, from the hand or power of Hell,</hi> or of the Grave; <hi>for he will receive me,</hi> Verſe 15. Nor can any meer man or Creature be able either to raiſe up the body out of the firſt death and Grave, or to deliver or preſerve us from the ſecond death, that we ſhould not periſh in that; for he that would preſerve from that, muſt have virtue in his Sacrifice, to take away by obtaining for us, and diſpenſing to us the pardon of our following ſins committed by us in our own proper perſons againſt the light and truth of God, and prevail with God for. Grace and Spirit to be given to us, and give it to us too, to inlighten, inliven, and raiſe from Spiritual death; diſcover the evil of ſin, and the deceits of Sathan, ſo as to enable the Soul to ſee and avoid them, and obtain and give grace for repenting of any ſuch ſins, and forgiveneſs of them thereupon, and for renewing the Heart; yea, he muſt be able to deliver from the power of Sathan, and his policy, or elſe he cannot deliver from periſhing,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53764:131"/>
either from the way to life, or in the ſecond death in the end, as the iſſue of periſhing from the way. Much leſs can any meer Man or Creature be able to give to us, or poſſeſs us of Eternal Life; becauſe to that it's requiſite, that the doer thereof obtain for us, and give to us the Spirit of Life, and power from God to quicken and enliven us to hope in, and love God, and there-through to be Holy to God, and preſerve in that holy ſtate againſt all Oppoſitions and Enemies; yea, and to raiſe the dead, and poſſeſs them of the everlaſting Kingdom, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and of Divine joys and ſatisfactions therein, which be works of Omnipotency, agreeable only to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature and Majeſty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For his being called forth to, and ſuffering death for us, the neceſſity thereof we have ſeen before in order to our ſalvation. We muſt have periſhed in the firſt Death and Judgment, had not he endured it, and given himſelf the ranſom for us; much leſs could he have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up himſelf a ſpotleſs Sacrifice through the Eternal Spirit, to make a purgation of our ſins, and obtain Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption for the taking away the following ſins, committed by us againſt the Grace and Mercy of God, exerciſed towards us, and extended to us in our ſeveral perſons, and making reconciliation for us; nor could there have been an improvement of his Sacrifice, by making interceſſion or mediation for preparing us for, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to Eternal Life. Indeed there could have been no ſins of that nature laſt mentioned, and therefore nothing to ſave from them, nor any Oblation or Offering of him ſelf, had he not ſuffered for his offering himſelf, ſuppoſes a ſuffering firſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24, 25, 26. And therefore without this, that would have found no place; nor any thing that follows thereupon unto Eternal Life; for which no Roome had we periſhed in, and never been raiſed from the firſt death</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:53764:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. And without his Reſurrection, neither had the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from the firſt Judgment been perfected; that Death had not been Aboliſhed or Evacuated, and he that had the power of it deſtroyed, nor the Reſurrection from it obtained. Much leſs could he have received in the Nature of man any power or authority to meditate with God, and work in and with men, in order to the preſerving the Sinners from periſhing, or for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and giving to any, or bringing them to Eternal Life. Theſe being the works of a living, not of a dead Perſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor could he have appeared for us as the great High Prieſt, in the preſence of God for us, in the Holy of Holies, upon the Mercy Seat and Cherubims of Glory, ſet down on the Throne of Majeſty on the right of God, unleſs he had been Exalted with Gods Right Hand being raiſed again. And without that he could not have ſent forth the Holy Ghoſt, and given Gifts to men for making him known; nor meditated with God for men, that their Sins might be forgiven, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences purged, their Hearts purified, and ſo they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and fited for, and brought by him through the Reſurrection of the Dead, and by his juſt Doom and Award as the great Judge of all unto Eternal life.</p>
               <p>Yea, in a word, ſeeing it is his being every way <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected through his ſufferings,</hi> and ſo being made the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of eternal Salvation to all that obey him,</hi> that renders him a meet Object to be believed on, and affords ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground thereto. That which was needful to render him an Object to be believed on, muſt needs be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood alſo to have been needful or neceſſary to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving from periſhing, and giving eternal life to any: For if he be able to preſerve from periſhing, and to give Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life without theſe things, then would he alſo without
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53764:132"/>
theſe things be an Object meet to be for them believed on. And ſo what was ſaid on the former Branch, proves the truth of this alſo.</p>

               <p>This I ſhall ſpeak to in two Branches, either of which is alſo evident and manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 1. Neceſſary it is for mens believing, that he be ſo lifted up by way of Demonſtration, for neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is for mens believing on him that they know him, and underſtand good ground and reaſon for believing on him. For Faith or Believing is not only an Act of the Heart, and will cloſing with an Object, coming to, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing help of, and relying and truſting upon it for that help, but alſo of the underſtanding. Such an Act of the Will aforeſaid as proceeds and ſprings from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Diſcerning and Perceiving, good reaſon and ground for what it doth therein; as may be ſeen in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53764:132"/>
what was Noted in the Acts, and things included or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in believing on him, and as may be ſeen in what both the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, in ſaying, <hi>They that know thy Name will truſt in thee,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. And in what our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, in <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 45. <hi>That no man can come to him</hi> (namely to ſeek and help, and Salvation in and from him, believe in him, and depend on him for it) <hi>except the Father that ſent him draw him:</hi> And that that drawing is by the <hi>Fathers teaching,</hi> ſo as that <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hears and learns of him comes to Chriſt:</hi> For Hearing and Learning of him, pertains to the right informing of the underſtanding in the things Taught; as alſo in that its ſaid, <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing is of the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.17. Only here it is to be minded, that we ſpeak of Explicite Faith, or Actual Believing; and not of an Implicite Believing, or of Gods gracious Imputation of Faith to Children, or the like, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cepting them in their not Acting againſt, as if believing on him. For certain it is, that the actual Faith that is by hearing, is ſuch as proceeds from an information of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſo an apprehenſion of ſome good cauſe or reaſon to Believe the thing informed of, and in or upon the Object commended to us in ſuch Information. Clear it is that no man believeth on any thing, or Perſon, for any help, or good to be received there-from; unleſs he apprehend there is Ability and Probability of finding help or good from it. Now no man can come to or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to find ſuch great effects as preſervation from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, Miſery and Wrath, deſerved by our ſins, and threatned of God to us becauſe of them, and a being raiſed up from Death and Grave, to eternal Life and Happineſs, from an ordinary man, that nothing differs from another, but is in the ſame ſtate of Sin and Death; and of the ſame Infirmity and Impotency with others:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53764:133"/>
Nor from an ordinary Prophet, or good man, that is alſo and confeſſeth himſelf a ſinner, and ſubject to like Paſſions with others, and ſtanding in need of Gods Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for himſelf as well as others; much leſs from any man appearing, and traduced, and judged by others (and they alſo Perſons of great Repute with men for Wiſdom and Piety) to be not only an ordinary man, but alſo a Worſman, or greater Sinner than many other men. And yet ſo was the caſe with our Lord Jeſus, the Son of Man (in reſpect of theſe laſt Expreſſions) for he in his appearance nothing differed from other men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born of a Woman, growing up by degrees in Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Wiſdom and Favour, as others, and ſubject to like infirmities of Humane Nature, as Hunger, Thirſt, Wearineſs, Sadneſs; and therefore alſo Eating, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sleeping, Reſting himſelf as others; and ſo found in Faſhion as a Man, and in the Habit of Men, of other ordinary Men; nay, below moſt men, being poor as to his Parentage, Education, and Injoyments, not having whereon to lay his Head, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.20. Yea (though not confeſſing himſelf a ſinner perſonally yet) repreach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and traduced as a ſinner, <hi>John</hi> 9.24. <hi>A Wine-bibber, and a Glutton, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners.</hi> Mat. 11.19. <hi>A Sabbath-breaker, a Samaritan, and one that had a Devil, and acted in his extraordinary Miracles by the power of the Devil,</hi> John 5.16.18. and 8.48. and 9.16. Mat. 12.24. <hi>A Deceiver, and Seducer of the People, and a Blaſphemer,</hi> Joh. 7.12. &amp; 10.33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.63. And therefore impoſſible it was that any man ſhould come to him, and believe on him, for ſo great things as Salvation from Sin and Wrath, and for Eternal life, unleſs he was ſome way lifted up and commended as a Perſon far beyond and above that outward Appearance and Opinion of him. Nor however he might be lifted up and commended to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53764:133"/>
men by either Spirit or men, yet unleſs thoſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of him ſhould be true, though they might beget a believing on him (for even ſuch as have been indeed Deceivers and falſe Chriſts, have through ſome falſe Prophets commendations of them, or their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions and boaſtings of themſelves, been believed on by men, as is implied alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.5.23, 24. <hi>John</hi> 5.43.) yet the believing on him in ſuch caſe, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be Divine nor profitable to Salvation. But here the commendations neceſſary to beget a right and Divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him, and to nouriſh it, are and muſt be true, and thoſe effects are worthily expectable from him, as we have ſeen in the former Propoſition and Concluſion. And it was neceſſary that ſuch commendations ſhould be given him by ſuch as rightly knew him (for none other could indeed rightly commend him) and none knew him fully but God his Father (as it is ſaid, <hi>No man knoweth the Son, but the Father,</hi> Mat. 11.27.) And his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which <hi>ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10, 11. And himſelf, who <hi>knew whence and what he was,</hi> John 8.14. And therefore it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that theſe in the firſt place ſhould exalt and lift him up by their Teſtimony, and Witneſs of him unto men. And ſo (as we ſee before) the Father bears Witneſs to him, <hi>John</hi> 5.32.36, 37. And he Teſtified of himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 8.14.18. And the Spirit bears Witneſs of him, both in the Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. and by and in his miraculous Gifts and Operations, and the mouths of his Meſſengers and Inſtruments, by whom he choſe to ſpeak, <hi>John</hi> 15.26, 27. and 16.13, 14, 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.6. It was neceſſary, I ſay, that by theſe he ſhould be Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated and Lifted up above what he otherwiſe appeared to be, &amp; above what men of themſelves apprehended him to be; and all that have apprehended or do apprehend of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53764:134"/>
him aright, are and have been begotten and brought to thoſe right apprehenſions of him, by the Teſtimony of Gods divine Teaching. Whence it is ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing him to be <hi>The Chriſt, the Son of the Living God, Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 16.17. And to the <hi>Jews,</hi> murmuring at him, <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſet me draw him.</hi> And to the Diſciples, <hi>No man can come to me, except it be given him of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> John 6.44.65. Which Gift is given in and by his Teaching and Demonſtrating him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 45. And, <hi>No man can ſay</hi> (that is knowingly and heartily ſay) <hi>that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. But foraſmuch as God is pleaſed ordinarily to Speak by men (his immediate and audible ſpeaking after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of God, being unbearable to men) to which purpoſe he hath Revealed himſelf to men, by Dreams, Viſions, Angels, and by his Word ordered by ſuch ways to men, whereby he made them Wiſe men and Prophets; and laſt of all by his only Son made the Son of man, hath given forth his Word, and the knowledg of it, and the Holy Spirit with it, to open it to them, and fit them to declare it to others; therefore as ſuch ways of giving forth his Word, and the knowledg of Chriſt to men was needful and neceſſary for Lifting him (the Son of man) up, that they might believe on him: So alſo the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſings and Declarations of ſuch men, that by Chriſt and his Spirit, and by ſuch other Ways and Means as God formerly made uſe of, were fitted for it, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the holding him forth, Commending and Lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him up to other men among whom they are, and to whom God ſent them; and ſo it was neceſſary there ſhould be the Miniſtery of men, even of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, to Commend and Lift him up to men: And they
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53764:134"/>
being Dead and gone, though their Words as to the main and ſubſtance of them be left ſtill with us, in which they have Lifted up, Praiſed, and Commended him in their faithful Declarations and Expreſſions, of what by Divine Inſpirations and Teachings concerning him they knew, and thoſe their Declarations are needful to be minded by us. Yet foraſmuch as all cannot Read their Writings left to Poſterity, nor all that do Read them, do know or underſtand them, or what is ſaid or ſignified in them; therefore needful it is, not only that ſome men ſhould be helped to Read, but alſo that ſome by the help of Gods Spirit (which is the Spirit of Wiſdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or Revelation in the knowledg of Chriſt, and opens his Words and gives underſtanding, <hi>Job</hi> 32.8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23.) in ſuch means as he is pleaſed to make uſe of, and breath in, ſhould be helped to underſtand them, and be gifted to declare their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them, and the knowledg of him according to them to other men, that they alſo may hear and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him through the help of the ſame holy Spirit, going along with the Inſtructions given them. And ſo he being aſcended on high, gave Gifts to men, and <hi>he hath given,</hi> as <hi>ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets;</hi> ſo alſo <hi>ſome Evangeliſts,</hi> or Goſpel Preachers, <hi>ſome Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for perfecting the Saints for the work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying the Body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the Faith, and acknowledgment of the Son of God to a perfect man,</hi> &amp;c. Epheſ. 4.7, 8.11, 12. And it was needful he ſhould give ſuch Gifts to men, to the end that he might be Lifted up by men in the Exerciſe of them. Yea, and that they be faithful to men, therein making it the great Buſineſs, Work, and end of all their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Gifts, and ſo of all their Miniſtry and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to Lift up and Magnifie the Son of Man, to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53764:135"/>
glorifie Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; by and from whom they have all their ſaid Gifts, and all their Mercies and Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beſtowed upon them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 8. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.12. Yea, and of all that know and believe in him, to confeſs him with their Mouth, and magnifie him both in Word, and Work, calling in others to him: And ſo it's ſaid, <hi>The Spirit and the Bride, ſay come; and let him that heareth, ſay come,</hi> Rev. 22.17. And this Witneſſing to him, and Lifting him up, as the Son of God, the Chriſt, the Saviour of the World, the Lord, the Ranſom of our Souls, who hath given himſelf the Ranſom, or Price of Redemption for all; the Teſtimony in due time, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and Reconciler, the Propitiatory or Mercy Seat, through whom God doth cover the Sins of men through Faith in his Blood, and the Propitiation for our ſins, and for the ſins of the whole World: The Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and Peace between God and man, and between men and men: The great Prophet and Apoſtle, Light and Leader of men into the Truth, true Knowledg, Faith and Worſhip of Cod, the great High Prieſt over the Houſe of God; the Mediator of God and man, that makes Interceſſion for Tranſgreſſors, and for all that come to God by him; the great King of Saints and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the Procurer and Giver of Remiſſion of ſins, and of the Holy Ghoſt, and of all Spiritual Grace and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; the great God and our Saviour, who hath the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; yea, all the Fulneſs of the Godhead dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him Bodily, and hath the Government of all things committed to him, ſo as he hath all Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over all things in Heaven and Earth, and hath the diſpoſe of all Mercies for this Life and that to come, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Corporal; the only Way to the Father to be worſhipped by us, and from the Father to Convey all Grace and Bleſſing to us; the Reſurrection and the Life,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53764:135"/>
yea, the All: I ſay, the lifting him up as ſuch a one, is exceeding uſeful and behoveful, yea, neceſſary for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting in mens hearts an exceeding high apprehenſion of him, ſo as to render him precious to them, more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then <hi>the fine Gold of Ophir,</hi> or <hi>the Mountains of Prey,</hi> and to lead them to <hi>account all things loſs and dung for the excellency of the knowledg of him;</hi> and ſo to come to, and believe on him. And though in all Ages, nor in all Places there hath not been given forth a like Expreſs and full Teſtimony of and to him, as there is given in theſe Ages and theſe Places wherein we live, having the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Apoſtles, and of the holy Spirit by them; nor where we have that, is there in every one the ſame fulneſs of underſtanding, firmneſs of belief, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of declaration of what is ſaid and contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Yet this in the fulneſs of it, and all that is in it, is very needful and behoveful for bringing men in to believe on him explicitly and firmly, againſt (and becauſe of) all the oppoſitions of the Devil and evil Spirits, and of the reaſon and wiſdom and ſtubbornneſs of the Fleſh, and carnal Heart, and the courſe and principles of the world tending to keep men therefrom, as to mens more diſtinct, full, and comfortable exerciſe of Faith in him. Indeed, as it is not of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, that every one have the ſame fulneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable exerciſe of believing; ſo alſo neither is it of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity that they have every one the ſame clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fulneſs of underſtanding, and perſwaſion of the commendations pertaining to him. Yea, as to Gods power to ſave men through him, I cannot aſſert a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a diſtinct knowledg of the Name and particular Acts of Chriſt at all (for doubtleſs many who died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation, and had no diſtinct knowledg of his Perſon and perſonal Acts in the fleſh were ſaved, as well
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53764:136"/>
as many Infants and others ſince) But yet generally needful it is that he be ſo far Lifted up and made known, and there-through that the heart be ſo far perſwaded of his Being, Fulneſs, Power, Excellency, Sufficiency, as that the heart ſee him the only excellent and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Object of Faith and Confidence, the only power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful One to be looked to, and hoped in by us, or elſe he cannot be diſtinctly believed on to Salvation, and Life everlaſting: <hi>Where there is no Viſion the people periſh, but</hi> (where there is ſo much as that people may ſee the Law and Doctrine of Chriſt, or the Mind of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them through him) <hi>he that keeps the Law is happy.</hi> Even that of the Law, that concerning him, or by and through him is made known, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.18. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. And where men have the clear knowledg of him to declare to others for their helpful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in believing on him, and they conceal it from men, woe to them for ſo doing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Br.</hi> 2. As the Exalting and Lifting up of Chriſt by way of Declaration of him as aforeſaid, is neceſſary for mens believing on him for Life and Salvation at the firſt, and further then he is made known in his Being and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, no man can have any Faith in, or belief on him: So this is neceſſary alſo to the abiding and growth in him, and recovery of the Back-ſliders to Faith in him again, that he be ſtill and always Lifted up and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Eyes of men, even of thoſe that have begun to believe, or have formerly believed on him. For if by any means, the Lifting of him up, and the Preaching and praiſes of him being with-held or neglected; the Serpent foiſt in high thoughts of ſome other thing or things, as better and fuller then he, or as neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him, and the Grace, in and by him for our Life and Salvation, or for our Welfare and Happineſs either here
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53764:136"/>
or hereafter, ſo as the thoughts or <hi>mind be corrupted from the ſimplicity in him.</hi> And he begin to appear or be looked upon as leſs, Full, Precious, and Deſirable the ſoul is in preſent danger to be withdrawn from him and be gone; ceaſing to believe and depend on him, or to do ſo ſingly and rightly for the Salvation and Life that is in and by him; which occaſioned the Apoſtles <hi>godly jealouſie</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians, leaſt by any means as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent beguiled</hi> Eve, <hi>their minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.2, 3. and ſo they ſhould fall from the ſincerity and ſtedfaſtneſs of their believing. And where there is a decay and danger of falling off, there can be no expectation or poſſibility of preſent growth, and going forward in the Believing: nor can any thing poſſibly recover the decayed and backſlidden ſoul to its believing again, but the undecieving the ſoul, and ſo purging out of it thoſe low and unwholeſome thoughts and apprehenſions it hath Sucked in of Chriſt, to the poyſoning of it from its believing on him; and how can that be done but by a freſh and more convincing Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Excellencies and Perfections in Chriſt, or the truth of the Teſtimony of God concerning him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly doubted of or rejected by the ſoul in its departing from him? Therefore we find the Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles lifting up of the Son of Man, not only to and for the drawing in men to believe on him. But alſo,</p>
               <p n="1">1.

Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> too thought it needful for him, <hi>to put the Believers in remembrance</hi> of the Grace in Chriſt Jeſus: As how? <hi>Through the knowledg of him all things are given us, pertaining to Life and Godlineſs:</hi> And that they were <hi>no cunningly deviſed Fables that were</hi> Preached to them by them, concerning <hi>the Power and Coming of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> and put them upon taking heed to the <hi>Words of the Prophets, and commandments of the holy Apoſtles of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Of whoſe coming again, and faithfulneſs to perform his promiſes therein, he alſo minds them that they might not be <hi>Led away with the errour of the wicked,</hi> and ſo <hi>fall from their own ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.3, 4.16.18 and 3.1, 2 10.14.17. So alſo the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> to perſwade to abide in believing on Chriſt, ſets before the Believers what a one Chriſt is, and the great Grace in him, and the Teſtimony of God concerning him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2, 3.9. and 2, 1, 2.24, 25, 26.28. and 5.10, 11, 12, 13. That <hi>knowing they have eternal life in him, they might believe:</hi> That is, go on to believe on him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To perſwade to and promote growth in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him, that they might be <hi>rooted and grounded in him,</hi> and be <hi>eſtabliſhed in the Faith, abounding therein with thankſgiving:</hi> and that they might <hi>grow in Grace, and in the knowledg of Chriſt.</hi> See to this purpoſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. and 3.8.17, 18, 19. and 4.16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. with 3.18. and many other places.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To recal and recover ſuch as began to decline, and turn aſide from him to other things, and ſo as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> wrote the things above mentioned, to ſecure from declining after falſe Teachers, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> underſtanding that the <hi>Galathians</hi> through ſome falſe Apoſtles, lifting up Circumciſion,

and the Obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law as neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thereby obſcuring and darkning of the Grace in Chriſt, were greatly indangered, inſomuch that he was <hi>afraid he had beſtowed on them labour in vain:</hi> To preſerve and reſtore them, makes it his buſineſs to lift up, or ſet forth Chriſt and the Grace in him, ſo <hi>Travelling in birth again till Chriſt might be formed in them,</hi> Gal. 1.4.6, 7. and 2.16.20, 21. and 3. throughout, with 4.4, 5.11, 12.19. and 5.2, 3, 4. Even as Chriſt alſo for recovering the Angels, of the Churches of <hi>Epheſus, Sardis,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> to their firſt Love, Life and Zeal, ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before them, and wiſhes them to <hi>remember whence they were fallen how they had received, and heard,</hi> and counſels to <hi>buy of him Gold tried in the fire,</hi> &amp;c. All which implies a need of continuing to lift up to the Son of man to the preſerving in, promoting of, and recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the believing on Chriſt. So alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> for recovering ſome of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from their denial of the Reſurrection, as alſo to preſerve the reſt in the belief of that Article and dependance on Chriſt, for the Benefit included in it, and promoting all their ſtedfaſtneſs and growth in Piety and good Works, minds them of the Goſpel fore-preached to them by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Jeſus Chriſt his Death, Burial, and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his anſwering and giving us Victory over the Law, Sin, and death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4.58.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Two other Concluſions ſhewing the Fulneſs and Sufficiency of this means, for begetting and preſerving in the Faith of Chriſt, and for bringing to the Salvation and Eternal life to which it is appointed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen two things are ſo ordered and diſpoſed, one for and toward the other, as that one be the way and means to the other, and that other the end whereto that way and means is directed, in caſe that which the means to the end be ſome rare, ſingular and coſtly thing; it may be ſuppoſed that when ſuch a means is made uſe of for and towards that end there was ſome neceſſity for it, either as to the abſolute or at leaſt the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent attainment thereof, as well as alſo that the end to be attained was of great uſefulneſs, excellency or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. But much more is it requiſite in ſuch a caſe, of the excellency and neceſſity of that which is the end, that what is ordered as the means, ſhould be apt, proper and ſufficient for the attainment of that end; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the means would be uſeleſs or in vain, and therefore I here add. That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſion</hi> 3. The lifting up of the Son of man in the ſenſe aforeſaid, is a full, perfect, proper and ſufficient way or means for prevailing with men (in their giving up or attending to it) to believe on him, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and increaſing the Faith of thoſe that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p>I put in that parentheſis, in their giving up or attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53764:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to it, becauſe Faith is of hearing; where men <hi>ſtop the Ear, and cloſe the Eye, and harden the Heart, left they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand with their Heart:</hi> There is no marvel if under the moſt excellent means they be not <hi>converted and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> or believing follow not. Yea, and where there is no <hi>taking heed to the things heard, that they ſlip not out:</hi> No marvel if the believing begun be ſo far from increaſing, that it come to nothing. The aptneſs, fitneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a means is ſufficiently evidenced, if being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied it produce its effect. No man judges a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine unfit or defective, that cures not the Malady without uſing or applying it; if but ſet in the Window, looked on with the Eye, or taken in the hand, yea, or but taſted and ſpit out again it heals not the Diſtemper: If it fail not to heal when ever duly applied, its an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Medicine, and may have a <hi>Probatum eſt</hi> written upon it. The waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> were manifeſted to be an apt, proper and ſufficient remedy for <hi>Naamans</hi> Leproſie, in that it healed him perfectly upon his ſeven times waſhing in it; though had he either gone away in his rage and not waſhed at all, or waſhed but four or five or ſix times in it, and not ſeven times as he commanded, his Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie had not been cleanſed. The like we might ſay of the Brazen Serpent that healed in being looked upon, though its bare ſetting up, or being felt on, would not have done it. Now that to ſuch as give up and attend to the Goſpel, its a means of begetting, preſerving and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Faith, it may be thus evidenced.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that its the way that God hath appointed; and its to be certainly believed that what God orders, is, and muſt be proper and ſufficient for the end whereto he orders it; his <hi>work being perfect, and all his Ways judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Deut. 32.4. We may not ſo injure the infinite
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53764:139"/>
Wiſdom and Goodneſs of the only wiſe God, who is Love and Goodneſs it ſelf, as to think that he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Creatures to improper or inſufficient means for their attaining the moſt excellent and neceſſary end; as if he either could miſtake himſelf, or would impoſe upon and delude us. Now that this is the means of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, is evident in this, that the Goſpel was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him to be Preached: <hi>For the obedience of Faith in all Nations,</hi> Rom. 1.5. and 16.26. And that it <hi>Pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of Preaching, to ſave them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> To whom alſo it is <hi>the Power of God</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. Even to ſave them from unbelief and diſobedience. Yea, its called the Word of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. both as its the Word that is to be believed, and as it begets and nouriſhes Faith where entertained. As alſo the <hi>Preaching of the Croſs,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>the Power and Wiſdom of God to the called</hi> (to ſuch as obey the call) both to lead and ſtrengthen them to, and direct and uphold them in believing on Chriſt and God by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22r 24. As alſo it is that <hi>Faith</hi> where-through the Believer is <hi>kept by the Power of God, to the Salvation ready to be revealed in the laſt days,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that in and by it all <hi>things are given us of God, pertaining to Life and Godlineſs,</hi> both to quicken to and in believing and preſerve in it, and lead out to the right worſhipping of God in the exerciſe of it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. as to ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A diſcovery of all ſuch things or Objects, as may move the heart to imbrace Chriſt, and preſerve it with him, taking it off from all other things. For therein is declared as was alſo noted before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The excellency of his Perſon, that there is none like him for us to believe on, he being <hi>the Son, the only

begotten Son of God, one with God;</hi> yea, <hi>God over all bleſſed for ever, Amen,</hi> John 1.1, 2, 14. and 3.16. Rom. 9.5. One by <hi>whom</hi> and <hi>for</hi> whom <hi>all things in Heaven and Earth were Created</hi> and made, and are <hi>by the word of his Power</hi> upheld, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2, 3. One that was in the Form, and hath the Riches and Fulneſs of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9.

               <p n="2">2. The greatneſs of his Love and Grace toward us, in coming forth from his Father in the fulneſs of time, to ſeek and ſave us; to that purpoſe emptying himſelf of all his Riches and Glory, and taking on him the <hi>form of a Servant, the faſhion of Men;</hi> yea, <hi>bearing our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities on his Body on the Tree,</hi> becoming <hi>poor, a man of Sorrows and acquainted with Griefs;</hi> yea, <hi>made ſin and a Curſe for us,</hi> to redeem us from ſin and Curſe, and to inrich, bleſs and make us Righteous; to that purpoſe Dying the accurſed and ſhameful Death of the Croſs for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. and 3.13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5, 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Which may perſwade us of his willingneſs to ſave and bleſs us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That all this was done to him, and ſuffered by him for the World, the whole World, for all and every one, and not only for ſome few, out of love to the world, and Grace to every one, God being <hi>not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance, and ſo to the knowledg</hi> and acknowledgment <hi>of the Truth, and to be ſaved,</hi> John 3.16, 17. and 12.47.

He delivered him for our Offences, and raiſed him again for our Juſtification;</hi> and did all things needful and abundant to him in Glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that he might be our Saviour, <hi>the Author of eternal Salvation to all that obey him,</hi> John 3 16, 17. Gal. 4.4. 2 Cor. 5.19, 21. Gal. 3.13. Iſa. 53.5, 6, 10, 11. and 42.1. Rom. 4.25. 1 Pet. 1.21. Heb. 5.9. For (as,</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is alſo declared in this Doctrine) He being ſuch a Perſon in himſelf, who did and ſuffered ſuch things, and doing and ſuffering them for us all by the will and appointment of his Father, and in Union of will with him; his ſaid Abaſement, Sufferings, and Death, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and owned of God, as (and ſo are) a ſufficient Ranſome or Price of Redemption for all. Both for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all from periſhing in and under that Death and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, which came upon all in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and for his Tranſgreſſion (out of which therefore all ſhall at laſt be Raiſed up by him) and alſo for Freeing, Diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and Delivering from Curſe and Death eternal, upon the account of their perſonal ſinnings againſt the Law, Goodneſs, and Grace of God in and through him, all or any that upon Convincement thereof in the

Yea, of ſuch Value and Force was and is his Obedience and Righteouſneſs therein with his Father; that upon account and in the virtue thereof, he is both <hi>the Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our ſins,</hi> that believing, have him our <hi>Advocate with the Father,</hi> taking away our defects, ſins and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from before him, ſo as we <hi>walking in the Light as God is, therein we have fellowſhip with God, and God with us, and his blood cleanſeth us from all ſin;</hi> yea, if through temptation ſinning, <hi>we confeſs it, he is</hi> here-through <hi>juſt to forgive us, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> And alſo he is <hi>the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> So as he obtains here-through a day of Grace and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards them, and keeps off deſtruction therein from them; and obtains the holding open, as it were, of a door of Repentance to them, and a Readineſs in God to accept of any of them in heartily repenting and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. Yea, he here-through obtains all that Goodneſs, Bounty, Long-ſuffering and Patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, which is afforded them; with whatſoever Calls, Counſels, means of Repentance and Grace, with Diſpenſations and Operations of the Holy Spirit, to Move, Lead, Excite, Provoke, and ſtrengthen to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith, are afforded to them that they might be Saved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5, 6, 9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. and 9.26. and 10.5.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. and 5.18. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. and 1.7, 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. and 13.38, 39. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18, 19, 20.

Whence it is called, <hi>The Miniſtration of the Spirit;</hi> and the Words of Chriſt ſaid to be <hi>Spirit and Life,</hi> becauſe of the Spirit Miniſtred therein, and there-with which <hi>Spirit quickneth and giveth Life;</hi> whence alſo it is <hi>a Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs and Life,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6, 8, 9. John 6.63. The Spirit is Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred <hi>not in the works of the Law, but by the hearing of Faith,</hi> Gal. 3.2. In the lifting up of the Son of man, or report given in the Goſpel of and concerning him, is <hi>the Arm of the Lord revealed,</hi> Iſa. 53.1. And this Spirit being the Arm of the Lord, muſt needs be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful for all that it is given or put forth to, either for beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, preſerving, ſtrengthening or increaſing this Faith, or believing on the Son of man. Whence it is alſo called the Spirit of Faith, <hi>We having the ſame ſpirit of Faith we alſo believe, and therefore we ſpeak, knowing that he that raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, will alſo raiſe us up by him,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13, 14. And <hi>God hath not given us the ſpirit of Fear, but of Power, and Love, and of a ſound mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7. As implying that it is the Effect and Fruit of the holy Spirit working in, and received by men, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and ſtand ſtrongly and ſtedfaſtly in the Faith, though under Temptations and Oppoſitions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Whence it alſo follows as a further Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſion</hi> 4. That the lifting up of the Son of man
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53764:143"/>
in the ſenſe aforeſaid, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Magnifying and Exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the view of men) is the proper and effectual means, though not for putting any thing into Chriſt for us, more then God hath put into him, and upon him, in his real Exalting and Lifting him up in his Perſon (for in that reſpect he is compleat and perfect before the Preaching and Teſtifying of him. The <hi>preparation for the poor</hi> was perfect before <hi>God gave the word, and raiſed up the multitude of Preachers,</hi> Pſal. 68.10, 11. Even as the Serpent was perfect in it ſelf as to what <hi>Moſes</hi> was to make it before he ſet it up on the Pole) Yet for the conveying Grace and Bleſſing to men, and putting his Salvation and Life Eternal into them.</p>
               <p>This in part was ſpoken to, and its truth ſhewed in what was ſaid above to the way of Chriſts ſaving the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever from periſhing from the way: And in what we ſaid of the Believers receiving, and having Eternal life, yet ſomething we ſhall further here note. And ſo, I ſay, this way of Exalting though it puts nothing into Chriſt, but only aſcribes and attributes to him what is in him; yet it brings ſomething into men, even of Gods ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to preſerve them from periſhing from the way of Life and Righteouſneſs, and ſo from the ſecond Death in the Concluſion, and of the Eternal life that is given us in him. And this may be further Evidenced and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from the Titles given to the Goſpel, as that its called <hi>the Word of Reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>The Goſpel of Peace,</hi> Epheſ. 6.15. <hi>The Goſpel of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Epheſ. 1.13. <hi>The Word of Life,</hi> Phil. 2.16. <hi>The Word of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Heb. 5.13. Yea, <hi>The Words of Eternal life,</hi> John 6.68. Which Names are given to it, not only becauſe it declares what God hath done in Chriſt for Reconciling us to himſelf, and making Peace: Or what Peace and Peaceableneſs is in the Heart
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53764:143"/>
of God towards us, or what ſalvation, righteouſneſs and life are given us in him; but alſo becauſe it is it ſelf the way, <hi>Medium,</hi> or power of God for reconciling the hearts of men to himſelf, and creating peace in them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17. and of ſaving, quickning and giving life, <hi>Num.</hi> 1.16. <hi>James</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.93. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us view the effects and fruits produced thereby in Men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therein, and thereby Chriſt gives forth his voice and divine light to declare and diſcover to Men where and what they are, what caſe and ſtate they are in, and where their ſafety lies, and which way they may attain it: Yea, what not? that may be uſeful for Men to ſee and know, for ſaving them from the powers of darkneſs, and what ignorance and error expoſe them to: Thus as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>the Light of the World,</hi> ſo his <hi>word</hi> that declares and lifts him up, is <hi>a light too, a light to our feet, and a lanthorn to our ſteps.</hi> Pſal. 119.105. <hi>Whatſoever makes manifeſt is light,</hi> Eph. 5.13. and this word manifeſts God and Chriſt, Sin and Righteouſneſs, Life and Death, and all things; and therein alſo is the voice of God and Chriſt calling to us to <hi>awaken and ſtand up from the dead that Chriſt may give us light;</hi> that ſo our <hi>feet may be directed into the ways of peace,</hi> Epheſ. 5.13, 14. yea, this makes the Preachers of, and walkers in it, <hi>Lights</hi> too to Men, as the Baptiſt who bare witneſs to Chriſt, as the <hi>Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the World,</hi> and lifted him up, as <hi>the true light, the Chriſt,</hi> preferring him before him, as one who was before him, was therein <hi>a burning and a ſhining light,</hi> Joh. 1.6, 7, 8, 9, 28, 29. &amp; 5.32, 33. And the Apoſtles whoſe work it was to witneſs to, and preach forth Chriſt and his excellencies, were called <hi>the light of the World;</hi> and were ſent forth to <hi>open mens eyes</hi> by their word, and <hi>turn them from darkneſs to light,</hi> Matth.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53764:144"/>
5.16. Act. 26.18. For with this voice and light in the exalting of Chriſt, is given forth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A certain divine force, power and operation of, and by the ſpirit to inliven, quicken, and ſo indue the hearer and receiver thereof with a capacity,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of ſeeing and diſcerning the light, and hearing the voice of the Lord, diſcovering and directing into the way of peace and ſafety; and ſo ſaving from the way of errour and deceit that leades to deſtruction; thence the light of Chriſt, which he gives in and by his Goſpel, declaring and preaching him forth, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the light of life,</hi> Joh. 8.12. as giving ſight alſo and perception where admitted; yea, even ſome that receive or retain it not, are ſaid <hi>to ſee and hear,</hi> and <hi>to cloſe their eyes, leaſt they ſee with their eyes, and stop their eares, leaſt they ſhould hear with them, and to harden their hearts leaſt they ſhould underſtand and be converted, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 13.15. Acts 28.26, 27. and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in that of <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. above cited, was ſent to give them <hi>ſight</hi> by the Goſpel, as well as <hi>light;</hi> a power to ſee what is ſhewed them, that they might flee from the evils and dangers of periſhing diſcovered, and follow after the life propoſed, and ſo for hearing his voice: <hi>The hour comes</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>and now is, wherein the dead hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live,</hi> Joh. 5.25. Yea Chriſt in his word by his divine power and force is giving alſo,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Underſtanding to the heart, as is implyed in that even now mentioned paſſage, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.15. and in <hi>Act.</hi> 28.26, 27. as alſo is implyed in wiſdomes call: <hi>O ye ſimple underſtand wiſdom; and ye fools be ye of an underſtanding heart:</hi> as implying that ſhe is in her calls ready at hand, in their hearing, and conſenting to her, to give them to be wiſe, and of an underſtanding heart;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53764:144"/>
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.4, 5. See alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.130. <hi>The entrance of thy words giveth light, and it giveth underſtanding to the ſimple,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, and makes wiſe the ſimple;</hi> yea and here-through,</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is turning the heart to the Lord, or there is that given forth which tends to (and will in the receiver) turn and convert the heart to him; as it is ſaid, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect</hi> (even that Doctrine which ſets forth the Lord, as well as is given forth by him; for it is both) <hi>converting the Soul;</hi> It hath power, virtue and tendency in its inſtructions; and is offering and effecting it, though men winking with the eye, and ſtopping the eare, leaſt they ſhould ſee and hear, and underſtand, and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, deprive themſelves of the efficacy of that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive force, and are not converted; as many whom the goodneſs of the Lord leads to repentance, through their hardneſs and impenitency are not led by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. and ſome whom God was purging, he ſaith, <hi>were yet not purged,</hi> Ezek. 24.13. <hi>But the eyes that ſee, and the eares that hear be bleſſed.</hi> Matth. 13.16. So as they ſhall ſee and hear more, the myſteries of the Kingdom ſhall they underſtand, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. Thus alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a <hi>choſen Veſſel</hi> to lift up the Son of Man by <hi>carrying his Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles and People,</hi> was ſent (as we ſee in what was before quoted from <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18) <hi>to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God;</hi> as many were actually and effectually ſo turned by him; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9, 10. by which it is evident, that the power and preſence of Chriſt by his Spirit, was in, and with his Preaching to that purpoſe. And truly when any are ſo turned to God in Chriſt, they are then in a ſtate of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are partakers of no ſmall or deſpicable a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſaving from periſhing, for which Chriſt is lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, being now out of the ways of falſhood and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53764:145"/>
and in the way to happineſs, being reconciled to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. and ſo in the way of life and righteouſneſs, wherein in the further or ſtill lifting up the Son of Man, and not otherwiſe. He is yet ſaving and giving life.</p>

And God is not known clearly, but by and in Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Image of his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Majeſty, and brightneſs of his Glory.</hi> And he is known in and by his being Lifted up, Diſcovered and Commended of God to us by his holy Spirit in his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: It follows, that Eternal life is herein given alſo in

               <p>A glorious Doctrine indeed, that hath ſuch glorious contents, or diſcovers ſuch glorious things; and that too to ſuch a glorious end, as the bringing us back to God, and ſo to his Eternal glory, to which he herein calls us by Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. and for the preparing us for, and bringing us, to which it is filled with ſuch excellent vertue and gracious efficacy, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it worthy to be called alſo the Goſpel of the grace of God; foraſmuch as therewith the grace and ſpirit of God is miniſtred alſo, as is ſhewed in the foregoing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, and as is ſaid in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle alſo aſſerts it to be far more glorious (as well as far more gracious) than the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> being ſuch as by repreſenting the great grace of God, gives great liberty and boldneſs to all that entertain it, yea, and repreſents therein the glory of God after ſuch a wonderful attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive manner, as is able to change the beholders thereof into its likeneſs from glory to glory, as by the ſpirit of

               <p>
                  <hi>Infer.</hi> 1. That its a great and wonderful mercy of God to any Perſon or People, to bring this bleſſed Doctrine in the openneſs and plainneſs thereof to them, and to lift up the Son of Man, therein to and before them, and to continue it with them, a mercy to be received with all acceptation and thankfulneſs, and with all diligence and care to be improved, ſo as to render to God for it fruits ſuitable and anſwerable to it, in all ſobriety and humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind in our ſelves, as being in and for all things infinitely indebted to his grace, without which we are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor could have done any thing to preſerve us from periſhing; and in all righteouſneſs toward men, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and godlineſs towards the Lord, who hath ſhewed ſuch light and mercy to us; this is that mercy of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, when He ſaith, <hi>That the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written, for this cauſe will I give thanks to thee among the Gentiles, and ſing unto thy Name,</hi> Rom. 15.9. For when this Goſpel comes, and is given to a Perſon, Family or People, God is therein <hi>granting them repentance</hi> (even of all former ſins and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obediences againſt all former means and mercies) <hi>unto life,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to the Brethren of the Circumciſion; <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18. diſcovering good ground and reaſon for it, and affording power and motive to it in the name of

Chriſt; yea, and a <hi>door of Faith</hi> too is therein opened, for their coming in to, and actually, and diſtinctly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.27. That thereby they may come and be made of the ſame Fold with other diſtinct Believers, <hi>fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A People no more at a remote diſtance from him, but near to him, even of the ſame Body with other Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers and <hi>partakers of the promiſes in Chriſt,</hi> even of the choiceſt Favours and Priviledges of the Saints pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to and covenanted with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and all the holy Ones: Yea, to be <hi>Built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets,</hi> and to be joyned to the Saints by the ſame <hi>precious Corner Stone Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and ſo to become in the Unity of the Spirit with them an <hi>holy Temple, and an habitation for God by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Epheſ. 2.13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22. and 3.5, 6. And ſo to be of <hi>the Royal Prieſthood, the Choſen</hi> or elect <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the holy Nation, the peculiar People,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. I do not ſay, that all that hear the Goſpel are made ſo; but I ſay, they have the Door opened to them, that in Hearing and Believing, they might be made ſo. Yea, when this Goſpel is brought to a Perſon, Family, or People, <hi>Salvation</hi> it ſelf <hi>comes</hi> therein <hi>to</hi> them, and <hi>life,</hi> even <hi>Eternal life:</hi> As it was ſaid to <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> Luke 19.9. <hi>This day is ſalvation come to thy houſe:</hi> For the Goſpel is the <hi>Power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth</hi> (for which believing alſo God therein opens the Door, and Miniſters Grace, as is before ſhewed) <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. And therefore alſo it is ſometime called as the <hi>Word of ſalvation,</hi> Acts 13.26. So alſo <hi>the Salvation of God,</hi> Acts 28.28. <hi>Be it known unto you, that the ſalvation of God is ſent unto the Gentiles, and they will hear it.</hi> And, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53764:150"/>
began to be publiſhed by the Lord himſelf?</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 2.3. For as God is diſcovering and ſetting before us to move to Repentance, and quicken to Life, the great Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Redemption, and Deliverance from under the firſt Death and Judgment, ſo as that none ſhall periſh therein, and upon that account mearly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. That none might keep themſelves out from hoping in, and coming to God becauſe their firſt Fathers ſinned, and they inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit their guilt and filth without remedy: And alſo that Power and Readineſs in God and Chriſt, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his perfect Obedience, Sacrifice and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſave or deliver the Believers from the Guilt of new ſins fore contracted in, and by our perſonal diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences during the time paſt of Gods forbearance, though committed againſt former and other leſſer manifeſtations of God, and of his Power and Goodneſs, Will and Commandment (as in the Works of Creation continued and his Providences mercifully ordered; and eſpecially in the Diſpenſation of the Law and Prophets) that none might Pine away in the conſcience of ſuch ſins, and be kept out thereby from believing and hoping in God, and in that hope Worſhipping him; and to accept them graciouſly, and juſtifie them freely from all things, from which they might not otherwiſe (no not by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>) be juſtified, and ſo to ſave and preſerve them from the Wrath to come, and from the ſnares of Sin and Satan which lead thereto. So alſo in the Preaching and making known this great Grace, he is ſaving the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of it (who cloſeth not his Eye, nor ſtops his Ears againſt, but obeys its diſcoveries) from the power of Satan and Darkneſs, and Tranſlates him into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his dear Son, and preſerves him unto everlaſting Life, as is before ſhewed. This is the Medium and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, whereby he effects this Salvation in and upon
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53764:150"/>
men; yea, even thoſe who by former and lower Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the knowledg of God are wrought upon, ſo as they do there-through, <hi>Fear God and work Righteouſneſs</hi> (as <hi>they that by Nature,</hi> or without outward verbal Inſtruction <hi>do the things contained in the Law, their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion ſhall be counted Circumciſion:</hi> That is, they ſhall through Chriſt though not diſtinctly known, be accepted of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26.) Yet they by the coming of the greater Means, the more open revelation of the Goſpel of Chriſt in its diſtinct and clear ſound, may be and are in receiving it ſaved by it; that is, they are delivered from former Ignorances, Miſtakes, Fears, Griefs, and Dangers, which the leſſer means of Light ſufficed not to remove. So we find that <hi>Cornelius,</hi> though an Angel of God teſtified to him, that his <hi>Prayers and Alms were accepted of God;</hi> and by the Spirit in the Scriptures, he is recorded to have been a <hi>Godly</hi> (or as we render it, a <hi>Devout) man, one that feared God, and gave much Alms to the People, and Prayed to God continually.</hi> Yet was directed to ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> that he and the other Gentiles with him might hear the word of the Goſpel by him, and believe and be ſaved; for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall ſpeak words to thee, by which thou ſhalt be ſaved, and all thine houſe,</hi> Acts 11.14. with 10.1, 2, 3, 4. and 15.7. So that Salvation both to thoſe who never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rightly underſtood, cloſed with or obeyed any other means of knowledg, and of the Fear of God vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to them (as appears not that any other of <hi>Cornelius</hi> Kindred did, however its evident of the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.28, 29. and of ſome of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> being For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, Idolaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11.) And to thoſe alſo who under and by former and leſſer means are wrought upon, and in complying with God in them are accepted of him, is the effect of the Goſpel. And they have a great and wonderful mercy afforded them, who
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53764:151"/>
have the clear lifting up of the Son of man vouchſafed them; that is to ſay, the Word of the Goſpel of Chriſt: It being a fuller ſaving Manifeſtation, and a more quickning Word and Diſcovery, as now in the fulneſs of it come forth ſince the Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Chriſt, then by any other way of Gods bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witneſs to himſelf (as <hi>he left not himſelf without Witneſs to</hi> the Gentiles <hi>in times paſt, when he ſuffered them to walk in their own ways;</hi> and they had not the Scriptures or plain Goſpel-preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17.) Yea, or then in the Prophets, or <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtration (which Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>John, Cornelius</hi> is ſaid to have known, though he was not thereby made a Circumciſed Proſelite, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.36, 37) was afforded. For this Doctrine is alſo called <hi>the Word of Life,</hi> not only as moſt plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Life given us from the Dead, through the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, but alſo as infuſing a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life into the receiver thereof, begetting him to a lively hope; as is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. And to be a kind of firſt-fruits of his Creatures, as <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. Whence that Exhortation, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Let every man be ſwift to hear.</hi> Yea, and the Wiſdom of God thence exhorts, <hi>Lay faſt hold of Inſtruction, and let it not go, keep her for ſhe is thy life,</hi> Prov. 4.13. And the Words of Chriſt are ſaid to be <hi>Spirit and Life,</hi> John 6.63. Yea, <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> For ſo Chriſt himſelf ſaid, <hi>I know that his Commandment</hi> (namely which I ſpeak) <hi>is everlaſting Life,</hi> John 12.49, 50. So Chriſt knew it whether others know ſo, or believe that his Knowledg was right or not. Thence alſo the <hi>Jews</hi> putting away this Word of God, are ſaid to have <hi>judged themſelves unworthy of Eternal life,</hi> Acts 13.46. And muſt it not needs be ſo, when the Holy Ghoſt tells us, that Chriſt himſelf is herein offered or given to men, to be Gods ſalvation to them, as in the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53764:151"/>
very next <hi>Verſe</hi> the Apoſtle implies, when having told the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they would turn to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> he adds, <hi>For ſo hath the Lord commanded us, ſaying, I have given thee for a Light to the Gentiles, that thou mighteſt be for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> (or as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. <hi>My ſalvation) to the ends of the Earth,</hi> verſ. 47. As implying that Chriſt (to whom and of whom the Lord in the Prophecy, ſpeaks) is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in, and with the Goſpel; and that both as a Light to them that ſit in darkneſs to diſcover the way of ſafety to them (and how great a Mercy is that) and alſo to be for their ſalvation: Namely both to pull them out of Death, and the power of Satan, and to lead and keep them in the path of Peace and Righteouſneſs, that they might not periſh, but have Eternal life. And what is tendred to men in the tender of Chriſt? Or what do men receive in receiving him? Is it not God in him? Yea, all the Promiſes of God, and Fulneſs of the Godhead, and his Grace and Bleſſing, as he ſaith himſelf: <hi>He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth him that ſent me,</hi> Mat. 10.40. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John,</hi> 2 John 9. He <hi>that abideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath both the Father and the Son.</hi> And in 1 John 2.24, 25. <hi>If that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you, ye ſhall continue in the Father, and in the Son; and this is the Promiſe which he hath promiſed us, Eternal life.</hi> Well therefore might the Apoſtle call the giving of the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles, The riches of the Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 11.11, 12. Seeing (as he there ſaith) in its coming, <hi>Salvation is come to them, to provoke the Jews to jealouſie:</hi> Whereupon he adds, <hi>If their Fall be the Riches of the World, and their diminiſhing the Riches of the Gentiles, what will their fulneſs be.</hi> Wherein is the fall of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Worlds riches, or their leſſening the riches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but in that Salvation which is the Goſpel,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53764:152"/>
with the Contents and Benefits of it (<hi>the Bleſſing of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14.) is thereby come to, and abides with them. Surely, this is the greateſt Riches or Treaſure of any man, or of any People, that they have the Goſpel, ſeeing they therein have Salvation, and Life, Eternal life, the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Chriſt; yea, and God himſelf in Chriſt. In a word, <hi>The Kingdom of God and of Heaven</hi> as the Goſpel is alſo ſo called) <hi>brought herein to them:</hi> So as in receiving and retaining it, all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Riches and Benefits are received, and retained by men. Well might <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, <hi>There is Gold and a multitude of Rubies, but the Lips of Knowledg are a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jewel,</hi> Prov. 20.15. as if he would ſay, a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Jewel then any of them all. Oh then that we <hi>Gentiles</hi> did know the Mercy and Goodneſs of God, and prize it accordingly! That we did underſtand, and mind, wherein our greateſt Intereſt and Happineſs lies! Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not in having the Riches of this World, or Trading for them; nor in having Power, Empire, Dominion and Rule; nor in Learning, worldly Wiſdom and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; nor in any of thoſe things which the other Nations were preferred in above <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but in having <hi>the Portion of Jacob,</hi> the knowledg of God and Chriſt, his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Oracles and Myſteries, brought to us, and left with us: And therefore that ſhould be our great buſineſs, not (as it is) to ſeek after Empire, Rule, Honour, Riches, and worldly Greatneſs; nor to ſatisfie our Luſts and Appetites, in the ways of the Heathen, in <hi>Surfetting and Drunkenneſs, Chambrings and Wantonneſs, Strifs and Envyings:</hi> But, in minding and receiving the Lip of Knowledg, the Word of God, the Goſpel of Chriſt. Oh therefore that we may <hi>repent</hi> of our Vanities, and <hi>believe the Goſpel,</hi> and give <hi>the obedience of Faith</hi> to it, as to that end its Preached to, <hi>and among all Nations,</hi> Mark

They that receive and retain this bleſſed Doctrine in which Chriſt is lifted up, ſo as they obey and walk therein, are very happy and bleſſed Perſons, in an excellent State and Condition; as our Saviour ſaid to the Woman, who admired the <hi>Womb that bare him, and the Breaſts which gave him ſuck,</hi> that they were bleſſed: <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>rather bleſſed are they that hear the Word of God</hi> (the Goſpel of Chriſt, or the Preaching of him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is lifted up) <hi>and keep it;</hi> that is, ſo as to mind and remember it, as a thing they believe and prize; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to practiſe, to do and obey what it inſtructs to, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.28. And needs they muſt be ſo (as appears by what is already ſaid) ſeeing they therein receive and have the Salvation of God, &amp; Life, even Eternal life; and therein the Riches, the Bleſſing, the Promiſes in Chriſt Jeſus, yea, Chriſt and God himſelf. Oh then! how <hi>bleſſed are they that know</hi> (underſtand, own, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>the joyful ſound,</hi> the Goſpel of Chriſt, the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Peace, and of good things in his Name: <hi>They ſhall walk, O Lord, in the Light of thy Countenance, in thy Name they ſhall rejoyce all the day, and in thy Righteouſneſs ſhall they be exalted,</hi> Pſal. 89.15, 16. and well they may, ſeeing they are actually <hi>of Gods houſhold, fellow Citizens with the Saints:</hi> Yea, <hi>Gods holy Houſe and Temple,</hi> in which through Chriſt he dwelleth, <hi>his People, his Children, his Inheritance;</hi> and God, and Chriſt is theirs, his <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> his <hi>choſen Generation,</hi> his <hi>holy Nation,</hi> his Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels and Treaſure, his Garden of Delight, thoſe in whom God and Chriſt take pleaſure; his <hi>pleaſant Plant,</hi> his <hi>Spouſe</hi> and <hi>Darling,</hi> the <hi>dearly Beloved of his Soul, a People near</hi> and dear <hi>to him,</hi> whoſe God, in a choice ſenſe he is.

                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:53764:153"/>
They be thoſe who receive, retain, and obey the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Doctrine, wherein Chriſt is Exalted and Lifted up: Theſe are in a Firſt-fruits Regenerated and Saved, and are in the way to enjoy Eternal life. Its theirs already as to Title and Intereſt, and holding faſt what they have received, they ſhall not fail of the full Injoyment of it. For this is the Teſtimony that God beareth of his Son, that <hi>God hath given us Eternal life, and that this Life is in his Son; ſo that he that hath the Son hath Life (and he that hath the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath both the Father, and the Son,</hi> 2 John 9.) Whence the Apoſtle adds, <hi>Theſe things have I written to you, that believe, that ye may know that ye have Eternal life, and that ye may believe;</hi> that is (go on believing) <hi>on the Name of the Son of God,</hi> 1 John 5.11, 12, 13. Knowing that ye have Eternal life, that ye are in as good a State and Way, as ye can be in here, that ye may perſevere therein. There is no other thing that can better the Believers condition, for in Chriſt he is <hi>compleat;</hi> the letting his Doctrine go, to ſeek any thing elſe to better him, is the way to deprive himſelf of all his Welfare: And <hi>by obſerving lying Vanities, to forſake his own Mercies:</hi> For, He <hi>that tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God,</hi> 2 John 9. nor Life, 1 John 5.12. Therefore the great thing that the Goſpel-Believers and Obeyers have to do, is <hi>to hold faſt what they have,</hi> and go on in the way that they are in <hi>till Chriſt come.</hi> As is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24, 25.</p>

               <p>An high honour in each reſpect it is ſure, and in its place far greater then to be Kings and Princes in the world, though not as to the commanding obedience in their own name, or requiring worldly reſpect and worſhip to be given them; for in that reſpect they are to be as ſervants to all, as Chriſt the great Prophet, Apoſtle, Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-preacher and Angel of God was, but their honour and dignity is meerly heavenly and divine, in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God, and to the ſouls of men, except only for order and decency among men; in which yet they are ſervants to God, and are not to defire to ſhare in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory from men with him, but only to ſeek the honour of him that ſends them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.16. and yet in reſpect to</p>

Yea, and ſo much the more as the ſouls of men are more precious then their bodies, about which the earthly husbandry, building, and other acts and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures are employed: the loſs of the ſoul is of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful great concernment, and God will require it of whomſoever the loſs of it proceedeth, if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the blood of men at the hands of men, as is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.7. Surely much more will he require the Souls of men, at the hands of men, with whom they are betruſted, if loſt by their negligence; ſeeing he hath valued them ſo highly, as that he hath not ſpared his own Son, nor Chriſt his own Life and Soul, but hath poured it out to death, to ſave them. And <hi>ſhall thy Brother for whom Chriſt dyed, periſh through thy meat?</hi> For thy ſloth, thy

Surely, if this were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it would make men careful how they undertake the Miniſtry, and having undertaken it how they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it, it would make them watch and labour with diligence, leaſt any ſhould miſcarry through want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or through want of skill (the product of ſloth and idleneſs, or ſome ſuch miſcarriage) and ſo the blood of their Souls ſhould be required at their hands, as God threatned the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 3.17, 18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Great humility and lowlineſs of mind, bewaring of pride, <hi>leaſt being puffed up, they fall into the condemnation of the Devil:</hi> Indeed, while they look upon the heighth and honourableneſs of their Employment, their Liberty to, and Intelligence with Heaven, the ſecrets they ſee into above others, and the excellent diſcoveries they have, and make of the great and high things of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the like, they may have Temptations to be proud and lifted up, and many there are that are apt to miſcarry that way; but it is a dangerous deceit, a Rock earneſtly to be ſhunned, and indeed none have cauſe to be leſs proud: Conſidering,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The exceeding heighth and weightineſs of their place and work, and their exceeding imbecility of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as of themſelves for the diſcharge thereof: This made <hi>Paul</hi> cry out. <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> 2 Cor. 2.16. Eſpecially conſidering too the great woe will befall them, as guilty of betraying Cods Name and Honour, and his great Deſign, the work and buſineſs of higheſt conſequence; and as guilty of the loſe of Souls that are moſt precious in Gods ſight, if through their miſcarriage they be loſt and periſh. Oh therefore with what care and humbleneſs of mind ſhould they walk! Indeed their honour is great, and their reward will be great, if faithful and ſucceſsful, but the difficulty of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53764:157"/>
their work aright, and obtaining the reward, and of walking worthy of their honour, ſhould keep them low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and humble: As alſo,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they have all that honour, not of deſert, but of Grace, and all their fitneſs for it, help and ſucceſs in it, not of or from themſelves, but from him that calls and imploys them, they have <hi>nothing but what they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> and received not as of Merit, but of Grace, and what they muſt alſo give an account of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in all their Service, and for all ſucceſs, they need to lean upon another, even Chriſt, and be helpen by him, they cannot flie up to Heaven by their own wings; their Wit, Learning, Induſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not inform them of the mind of God; it muſt be from God himſelf, and they cannot lift up themſelves into the ſight and hearing of him, ſo as to receive meſſages from him, but only by the ſtrength and length of the Ladder, that is erected for their aſcent, if they neglecting to look to relie and lean upon that, aſpire to know and underſtand otherwiſe, thinking by their own Wit, Learning, Philoſophy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to attain it, they will periſh from the way, and fall in their attempts, and be deſtroyed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.30. and when they have by Chriſt, as the Ladder mounted up and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and received information, they cannot profitably to themſelves and others deſcend again, but on the ſame Ladder; on, and by the ſtrength, ſupport, and aſſiſtance of the Son of Man, <hi>John</hi> 1.52. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. So that no cauſe to be high-minded, but with humility, and the fear of the Lord, depend on Chriſt for all things, both towards God, and towards men; ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.4. And indeed,</p>
               <p n="4">4. The very things they ſee and ſpeak of, may move them to be humble, and not lift up themſelves, either in the ſight of God or of men: For, do they not behold the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53764:157"/>
glory of God, in the view whereof how low are they, ſo as they cannot utter what they ſee and hear; how vile and ſhort are they then in compariſon of him, with whom they have to do; the ſight of his Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, his infinite Holineſs, and Purity, how might it make them cry out with the Prophet <hi>Iſoiah, Chap.</hi> 6.5 <hi>Woe is me, for I am a man of polluted Lips,</hi> &amp;c. The greatneſs of his Goodneſs, How can they ſee and not be abaſed to ſee how far they fall ſhort of anſwering it? And the greatneſs of his Terrour, How ſhould it not make them fear, leaſt they ſhould fall under it? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10, 11. Yea, the greatneſs of his Humility Preached by them in the Grace he ſhewed to us men, is ſuch as may both inſtruct them to imitate him therein; ſeeing that's the Way by which he obtained his Glory and Honour, and did ſo much Service to his Father, and good to us men, and is declared to be our way to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour too, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.12. And may caſt ſhame upon us, if after the ſo great Humility of ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a One, we be proud and haughty; who have nothing of our own that's fit to be gloried in; and are infinitely ſhort of what he was in all the good we receive from him, and do through him, Yea, and</p>
               <p n="5">5. It's not the place of Miniſtry, and the excellency of the Work and Office committed to a man, not the Office of an Apoſtle, or Prophet, much leſs of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Miniſter of the Goſpel, nor the excellency of Gifts and Furniture for diſcharging it, that is any mans Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or the thing for which God accepts him; but his being found in Chriſt, believing on him, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him faithfully in what ever place God ſets him; or rather Chriſt himſelf as ſo believed in, and obeyed by him, <hi>It's not</hi> either <hi>the Hearer,</hi> or the <hi>Preacher of the Word,</hi> that is thereby <hi>Juſtified,</hi> but the <hi>doer of it.</hi> Yea. and</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:53764:158"/>6. For, and by Pride, and other Miſcarriages, many highly Honoured and excellently Gifted Perſons, have fallen from their higheſt Places, to deepeſt Miſeries. <hi>The Angels who leſt their firſt habitation, were thruſt down to Hell, and are reſerved in Chains of Darkneſs, to the Judgment of the Great day,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.4. And, <hi>Judas who had a part in the Apoſtleſhip, yet falling down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, burſt aſunder, and all his Bowels guſhed out,</hi> Acts 1.17, 18. And Chriſt ſhall ſay to many that will plead, <hi>They have Propheſied in his Name, and in his Name caſt out Devils; depart from me, I know you not, ye workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Mat. 7.22, 23. Such a conſideration moved the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> (and may move us and others to the like Care and Practiſe) <hi>To be at down his own Body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt having Preached to others, he himſelf ſhould be a Caſt away,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. As alſo on the like conſideration of Gods dealing with the <hi>Jews,</hi> he gives us this advice; <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by Faith, be not high minded but fear; for if God ſpared not the natural Branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee,</hi> Rom. 11.21, 22. For which is</p>

                  <hi>Infer.</hi> 4. Seeing the Goſpel Doctrine is that in which the Son of man is Lifted up, and therefore of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency as is fore-ſhewed. It follows too, that they who withhold. Abuſe, or hinder the Preaching of the glorious Goſpel, are in a ſad way, and expoſe themſelves to great Condemnation. I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as being betruſted with it, do withhold it; whether they do as <hi>Onan,</hi> becauſe they know <hi>it is to raiſe up Seed to their Elder Brother, ſpill it on the Earth:</hi> Becauſe not they, but Chriſt ſhall have the glory, are unfaithful with their Talent, conceal the Words of the Holy One.

aſide from) Preaching the Word, and Doctrine of Chriſt. We read what our Saviour ſaith, ſhall be the Judgment of ſuch Perſons, <hi>viz. Take away the Talent from him, and bind the unprofitable Servant hand and foot, and caſt him into the outward Darkneſs; where ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 25.18, 24, 28, 30. Thence the Apoſtle having a Diſpenſation of the Goſpel committed to him, cries; <hi>Woe is me, if I Preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.16. If a man fitted for it, for the love of this World embracing it like <hi>Demas,</hi> and deſirous to follow the Riches, Honours, Pleaſures of it; or to avoid the labour and work of Preaching, Winning and Watching over Souls; or to avoid the Croſſes and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings that attend it here, keep ſilence or forbear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from Preaching it, as God opens doors and gives him opportunities: Surely ſuch a man greatly diſpleaſes God, as one injurious to, and diſhonouring him, as if he were an hard and unjuſt Maſter, and his Service diſadvantagious, and he wrongs the Souls of men, from whom he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds what is for their Profit and Benefit: And therefore this high Calling is upon no ſuch ground to be Omitted, Neglected, or Turned away from, but it is to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted willingly, and diſcharged faithfully and diligently, in Eye to, and confidence in Gods Greatneſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to uphold and bleſs in it, and reward for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But much more are they faulty who abuſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And ſo they do who</p>
               <p n="1">1. Corrupt or Pervert it; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.7. Making it another thing then what it is in it ſelf, and from God; like <hi>Wine mixed with Water:</hi> Or, <hi>Silver become droſs,</hi> Iſa. 1.22. Or Meat mixed with Poyſon, while the Name of God, and the Son of man is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, waved, or laid by, and Dreams and Fancies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof Preached. The Grace of God in its Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53764:159"/>
Fulneſs, and Extent not held forth; but a Mingle-mangle, or Hotch-potch of Grace and Works: Chriſt and <hi>Moſes,</hi> or ſome other Name or Doctrine in ſtead thereof declared; ſuch as puts men upon waiting for, and expecting ſome Almighty and irreſiſtable Operation and Force of Spirit, to Convert and Aſſure them. But in the mean time, the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is the Power of God to Salvation to them that believe, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and Rejected by them, and Preached againſt, even the Love of God to the World; and ſo the Diſcovery of the Son of man, and the Grace in him for ſinners; and for all men, in which the Power and Spirit of God breaths, and the Saving and Enlivening force is offered. Men are taught to neglect that, and the Power and Force working in it to look for another &amp; greater, til by Stifling and Crucifying, that they periſh. Like the <hi>Jews</hi> that rejected Jeſus, and the Grace diſcovered in, and by him, to look for another Meſſias of far more Pomp and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour then he. Or, as if ſome ſhould have Taught the Wounded <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to have looked for ſome immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Power beſide the Serpent, inſtead of looking to the Serpent, through which God puts forth his Almighty Power for their Healing. They who ſo do, are to be avoided as poyſoners of Souls, in ſtead of good and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Phyſicians: Or as the Corrupters of the Fountains, and Springs, of all true Piety, and acceptable Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3, 4.

                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:53764:159"/>

Let Men ſpeak as gallant words as they can imagine, and uſe all the skill that Art, and Induſtry can ſuggeſt; yea, that the moſt wiſe and ſubtle ſpirit can teach them, <hi>Speak with the Tongue of Men and Angels,</hi> uſe the moſt powerful demonſtrations Logick can make, and the moſt perſwaſive arguments Oratory can invent and make uſe of, yet if there be nothing of the Son of Man in it, nothing of Chriſt, and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it avails nothing to our Salvation and enjoyment of Eternal Life. But He alone diſcovered (and the better
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53764:163"/>
the more nakedly, and with the leſs artifice and uſe of thoſe Sciences) is able to effect all in us; for God hath made void the <hi>wiſdom of this world;</hi> the <hi>wiſe,</hi> the <hi>Scribe</hi> and the <hi>Diſputer of this World,</hi> are with him mere ciphers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20.

Yea, He honours him with his own, with all his own honour and glory; which he will not give to any other beſides him, either thing or perſon: Surely he muſt needs be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inexpreſſibly honourable and glorious; ſeeing God is infinitely honourable and glorious himſelf, and honours him not according to the dictates of the wiſeſt and higheſt Creatures (with whom he takes no counſel in this, or any other matter) but according to his own wiſdom, underſtanding and goodneſs, which are all infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

So as <hi>all that the Father hath is his,</hi> Joh. 16.15. and he is <hi>Lord of all,</hi> Act. 10.36. He that <hi>was in the form of God,</hi> made <hi>himſelf in the form of a Servant,</hi> and in the <hi>habit of a Man,</hi> even of an ordinary man for our ſake, having neither outward <hi>form</hi> or beauty, <hi>when we ſee him that we ſhould deſire him:</hi> nor Authority and Power to command any man, but ſuch as voluntarily became his Diſciples: but, now the Sun is not ſo glorious, much leſs was the body of <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, as his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorified is, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.13. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.21. Nor, is there any Authority beſide comparable with his. <hi>Adam</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had Dominion over Gods works that are viſible in Earth and Sea, but all Authority both in heaven and earth, is now given to him, and he doth exerciſe it over them. <hi>Adam</hi> knew how to call all the names of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, but Chriſt not only knoweth what is in them, and in men alſo; yea, <hi>all men,</hi> Joh. 2.24, 25. but alſo he knows his own name, and his Father and Fathers name, which none elſe doth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Adam</hi> then had proviſion made for him, that he might in ſtanding, live, and been immortal; a Garden planted, furniſhed with all variety of Trees and Fruits, pleaſant to the ſight, and good for food; and a River of Water running therein to water it, and a Tree of Life in the midſt of it.</p>
               <p>And ſurely Chriſt, as he had delight in God, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of glory and ſatisfaction in, and with him, before his Incarnation (it being the ſame glory he had with him before the World was, that now he hath, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5)

So now alſo he lives in God (<q>yea, when in the fleſh, he lived by his Father, as he that eats him lives by him;</q> Joh. 6.57) and it was, and ſurely is <q>his meat and drink to do his Fathers will,</q> Joh. 4.34. and <q>He alſo hath planted a pleaſant Garden, and an Orchard of Pomegranates with pleaſant Fruits, Camphire, Nard, Spikenard, Saffron, and Calamus, and Cinnamon, and all the Trees of Frankincenſe, Myrrh and Aloes, with all the chief Spices; and there is (or rather he is) the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Gardens, a Well of living waters, and ſtreams from Lebanon,</q> Cant. 4.15.  <q>And he exerciſes himſelf to dreſs this, as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> his; and he eats of his pleaſant fruits, which it brings forth to him. Gathers his Myrrh with his Spices, eats his honey-comb with his honey.</q> The fruits brought forth by his ſpirit in his People are the joy of his heart, and as his pleaſant meat; and he <q>drinks his Wine with his milk; even the love of his Spouſe, and of his Children to him, which he hath begot in them, by his ſpirit, and the expreſſions of it;</q> 
                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.11, 13, 14. and 5.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.11. And he is all this to us and for us. <hi>Adam</hi> again had a Sabbath to reſt in; and ſurely Chriſt reſted in the Father, and in his love, even before the foundations of the World; and <q>reſts in his love to his People,</q> 
                  <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17.<q> Yea, and having offered one perfect Sacrifice now to God for us, is ſet down, and reſts for ever from all his ſufferings and toilſome work and ſervice in his Prieſtly miniſtration, at his Fathers right hand; there expecting till all his foes be made his foot-ſtool,</q>

                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Adam</hi> was Male and Female, as <hi>Adam</hi> is the

common name of both, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.1. and Chriſt takes on him both formes often. He is <hi>the man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. Yet ſometime he is repreſented in the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine forme; as <hi>Wiſdom hath built her houſe, and hewed out her ſeven Pillars,</hi> Prov. 9.1, 2. And as <hi>he is the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Father,</hi> that begets Children to himſelf, and to his Father: So, he brings them forth too, <hi>through the travail of his Soul,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. and 53.10. Yet, as God ſee it good for <hi>Adam</hi> not to be alone; and therefore he made him an help-meet for him out of his ſide, while he was caſt by him into a deep ſleep: and ſo formed the woman for him, and brought her to him that <hi>leaving Father, and Mother, Man might cleave to his Wife:</hi> even ſo Chriſt alſo hath a Spouſe formed out of his ſide; <hi>out of his fleſh, and out of his bone,</hi> through his ſleeping in death; which he hath left Father and Mother to cleave unto, and in her is his delight, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.4, 5. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were naked, and were not aſhamed in their innocent ſtate (or, as the words may be read, they behaved themſelves prudently, and did not ſhame themſelves, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.25) and did not ſee themſelves naked, till they had ſinned; for, till then, they were comely through the beauty and glory of God upon them, and their integrity and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; and Gods favour and protection was their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and cover, from any thing that might harm them: but after they had ſinned, and Chriſt was interpoſed to be their Saviour, God clothed them with Coats. So Chriſt alſo, and his Spouſe are repreſented as naked ſometimes one to the other; and there is no ſhame therein. So Chriſt is nakedly repreſented, in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.12, 16. and ſo we find the Spouſe his Church ſet forth, as exceeding comely, lovely and beautiful, without any Ornaments, or clothing mentioned, ſave upon her feet, to keep her clean, and ſafe in her walking with him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.1, 7. Yet, at
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53764:174"/>
other times we find Chriſt repreſented as clothed, not as having any thing of ſhame to be hid and covered; but as <hi>Adam,</hi> before he ſee himſelf naked, was covered with the glorious Ornaments of his own virtues, and the glory of God upon him; So it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with Majeſty, the Lord is clothed with ſtrength, he hath girded himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 93.1. and in <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. we find him <hi>clothed with linen,</hi> his own innocency and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the high Prieſt that was to offer the atoneing Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and <hi>girded with the fine gold of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>phaz:</hi> that is, with his truth, more precious then the fineſt gold; as in Iſa. 11.5. <hi>Righteouſneſs the girdle of his loynes, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs the girdle of his reines;</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.12. we find him <hi>clothed with a Garment down to his Feet:</hi> The Robe of Righteouſneſs, wherewith he covereth his whole Body, the Church, even to his loweſt and meaneſt Members; <hi>and girt about the paps with a golden girdle;</hi> his heart girt with love and <hi>charity</hi> (or ſtrengthned therewith) <hi>the bond of all perfection,</hi> as its called, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.14. He hath (as Princes uſe to have) changes of Raiment, in which is much preciouſneſs. We may find him ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his People <q>in Garments of Salvation and Praiſe;</q> 
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. And ſometimes <q>clothed with Garments of Vengeance, againſt his and their Enemies:</q> So in <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.1. We find him <hi>clothed with a Cloud</hi> (as threatning tryal to his Church, or vengeance to his Enemies; and <hi>with a Rain-bow about his head:</hi> as mindful of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them that fear him, in Iſa. 59.17. <q>He is clad as a Man of War, having righteouſneſs on as a Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, and the Helmet of Salvation on his Head, (which he hath for his Body the Church alſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.14, 15) and he put on the Garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal, as a cloak.</q> And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.1, 2. He is repreſented <q>red in his Aapparel, and his Garments
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53764:174"/>
dyed and ſtained with blood; becauſe of the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance executed by him on his Enemies,</q> as alſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.12. <q>But when he is clad as a Bridegroom or Suitor to our Souls, all his Garments ſmell of Myrrh, Aloes, and Caſſia, (ſweet, healthful, and purging Spices and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes) out of the Ivory Palaces wherewith they have made him glad,</q> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.8. And we find his Spouſe clothed and adorned by him, and for him too, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7, 8. But of theſe things I ſhall not ſpeak more largely.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We have ſeen the perfections of man. Let us a little (as we may) view alſo thoſe of the Angels. He is alſo called, <q>the Angel of the Covenant</q>. Angel is in Engliſh a Meſſenger, and therefore ſo tranſlated in our later Editions of the Bible, in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <q>The Angel of Gods preſence that ſaved Iſrael,</q> 
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. And that redeemed Jacob out of all evil; and had power of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16. And ſurely He is the higheſt and beſt Meſſenger, or Angel that was ever ſent of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his only Son. Nor can we find any excellency in the Angels, in which he doth not out-ſtrip them: They are ſaid <hi>to excel in ſtrength, doing Gods commandments:</hi> Pſal. 107.20. but they excel not, nor equalize him in either: They cannot <hi>uphold all things by the Word of their Power,</hi> as He doth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Nor could they ſtand under the weight of our ſins, as He did; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. Therefore they give him the preheminence; and judge him only <hi>Worthy to receive the Power, Riches, Wiſdom and Strength, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory and Bleſſing,</hi> Rev. 5.12. Nor do they Gods Commandments, like or equally to him, who <hi>obeyed to the death, the Death of the Croſs, laying down his life at his Fathers commandement,</hi> and <hi>delighting to do his will</hi> therein; ſo as to bear and take away our ſins by the ſacrifice of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53764:175"/>
himſelf, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. and 10.5, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.48. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.31. They are alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and underſtanding ſpirits, great in knowledge, and excellent in ſpeech, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. yet far ſhort of him: for, God hath found folly in them, ſaith <hi>Job</hi> 4.18. but Chriſt <hi>is the wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24. <hi>knowing his Father,</hi> whom none elſe ſo knows, Matth. 11.27: and <hi>grace is poured into his lips,</hi> ſo as <hi>God hath bleſſed him for ever;</hi> Pſal. 45.2. They are alſo great in power, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch of them as are called Principalities and Powers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, 21. but not equal with Chriſt, to whom all of them are commanded to give worſhip. <q>He hath obtained a far more excellent name by inheritance then they, as may be ſeen,</q> Heb. 1.5, 6. to the end. They are indeed <hi>Spirits,</hi> but <hi>miniſtring Spirits</hi> to him. He is <q>the Lord that Spirit, the quickning Spirit, ſo as none of them are;</q> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. So that in him are all the perfections, and more then all the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Creatures: Yea,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Yea, all that God afforded to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, in their Travels, as needful for their Life, Chriſt is made it of God to us; the <hi>Bread of God that comes down from Heaven,</hi> that gives power to eat of it ſelf, becauſe its <hi>living Bread</hi> (ſo as that Manna could not do, becauſe not living) and gives Eternal life to what eats it too, whereas they who eat that Manna died, <hi>John</hi> 6.50.58. And he is the true <hi>Rock,</hi> from whence ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the Rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> (the Curſe of the Law) for

But a far ſtronger and more laſting Rock, then that as being <hi>Eternal,</hi> and afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better Waters that will <hi>ſpring up in them that drink them unto Eternal life,</hi> John 4.14. They had a Serpent lifted up to heal them when wounded, and he is that as here is noted. The Cloud too, to go before and giving us with himſelf, alſo <hi>a cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> and a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Shadow. And a Pillar of fire to give us Light by Night, even in our darkneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is alſo for our well and comfortable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; many things we need to make our lives more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and we have all good to that purpoſe in him too. As for Inſtance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's a comfort to have good Company and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It was not good for the man to be alone. He that hath Chriſt, never wants good Company, for he will be with us: He <hi>will never leave us nor forſake us, ſo that we may boldly ſay: The Lord is my helper, I will not fear,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 13.5, 6. Iſa. 43.2.3. For he is as good as Ten Thouſand, and more. He is enough to ſet againſt the greateſt Army, or Multitude. So when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> would comfort his people againſt the numerous Army of the King of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> he tells them, <hi>There was more with them then with their Enemy,</hi> and when he comes to account, he mentions none but <hi>the Lord their God,</hi> 2 Chron. 32.8. for he hath all at his Beck. If <hi>David</hi> was <hi>worth ten Thouſand of the</hi> people, 2 Sam. 18.3. How much more worth is the Son of <hi>David,</hi> who is <hi>Davids Lord?</hi> He that hath him, having the Father alſo; they come together to abide with them, who receive and keep his words, <hi>John</hi> 14.23. and ſo we may have <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father, and with the Son,</hi> 1 John 1.3, 4. And to be ſure the holy Spirit is not wanting where they
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53764:177"/>
Two are, for <hi>they Three are one,</hi> 1 John 5.7. And the holy Spirit is upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. Yea, and an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of Angels do attend him, and the Church of the Firſt-born, and the Spirits of Juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its comfortable to have Friends and Relations, and they have all that have him: For he is that <hi>Friend that loves at all times, and the Brother born for adverſity,</hi> Prov. 17.17. Yea, he ſtands in all, and affords the comfort of all Relations: The <hi>everlaſting Father,</hi> and yet <hi>the Child born for us,</hi> and <hi>the Son given to us,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. That <hi>cares</hi> for us <hi>as a Father,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.14. 1 Pet. 5.7. And <hi>comforts</hi> us as <hi>a Mother,</hi> Iſa. 66: 12, A Brother to us, and <hi>not aſhamed to be ſo</hi> called, Heb. 2.12. And yet owns us as a Mother, as well as Brethren and Siſters, <hi>if we do Gods will, hearing his Word and keeping it,</hi> Mat. 12.49. He bids us <hi>call Wiſdom our Siſter too, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our Kinſwoman,</hi> Prov. 7.4. And <hi>he is Wiſdom,</hi> and (hath) <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and gives it to us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1.14. with <hi>Luke</hi> 11.49. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.34. So then, as we are Children begotten by him, he is our Father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.18. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. As we are the Fruit of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail of his Soul. He is to us (and pities, and loves us as) a Mother, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.13, 14. As we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his Divine Nature, and he of our humane, he is our Brother, and as he is the Wiſdom of God, our Siſter, and Mother, as we conceive in our hearts in the knowledg and faith of him, and he took his humanity of us, or of our Nature he is our Child or Son; yea, he makes his Relations ours, his Father our Father, his Brethren and Siſters ours, and ſo us to be Brethren to each other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8. <hi>John</hi> 20.17. Yea, as we are his Sheep he is our <hi>Shepherd,</hi> to take care of, feed and lead us, and preſerve us from evil, <hi>the good Shepherd,</hi>

John 10.15. As we are his Diſciples, he is <hi>our Maſter,</hi> and as we are his Servants, ſo <hi>he is our Lord;</hi> not hard and froward, but Good, Gentle, and Righteous, our <hi>Maſter in heaven,</hi> Mat. 23.10 Col. 4.1. John 13.13. As we are a <hi>City,</hi> he is our <hi>Ruler and Governour,</hi> as we are his Subjects, he is <hi>our King,</hi> as we are Eſpouſed to him, he is <hi>our Husband,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5. And Good, yea, Excellent in all theſe, and affords the Comfort of all theſe Relations in the moſt excellent manner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its comfortable to have good Chear, rich Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Accomodations, Mirth and Pleaſures, lawful and allowed of God. And Chriſt is, and affords all this to us, not only Bread to ſtrengthen our Hearts, but alſo <hi>a Feast of fat things full of Marrow;</hi> not only <hi>Water,</hi> but <hi>Wine and Milk, Wine on the Lees, and well Refined,</hi> Iſa. 55.1, 2. and 25.6.

               <p n="4">4. Yea, in a word, Riches and Honours are often comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and <hi>Riches and Honours are with him, yea, durable Riches and Righteouſneſs, his fruit is better then Gold, yea, then fine Gold; and his Revenues then choice Silver,</hi> Prov. 8.18, 19.

He is a Tree of Life to every one that lays hold on him, and happy is every one that retains him,</hi> Prov. 3.13.18. He and his Preſence gives joy and delight, and is a Spring of Content and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in a Firſt-fruit here, 1 Pet. 1.6, 7, 8.

All thoſe alſo he is, and affords to us; As to ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. Its needful for us, that there be a <hi>place</hi> for us to worſhip and meet with God in; as of old he appointed a Sanctuary for himſelf to dwell in among his People, a Tabernacle, and after that a Temple, an holy and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Place, ſet apart and ſanctified for his Name, where they might wait upon him, bring their Offerings, preſent

their ſervices to him, and worſhip him, and where <hi>He would meet with them and bleſs them,</hi> Exod. 24.20. and 25.9. and 29.34, 35. <hi>An houſe of prayer for all People;</hi> wherein he would <hi>accept their Offerings and Oblations:</hi> 1 King. 8. &amp; 9. 2 Chron. 6. &amp; 7.12, 15, 16.

And theſe were tipes of better things; which being now come, God injoyns not any ſuch obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſuch places, but inſtead thereof Chriſt himſelf is the <hi>true Temple,</hi> the great and glorious Temple, in <hi>whom dwells all the fulneſs of the God-head bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19, 21. where God will be worſhipped, and will accept and bleſs us; and by faith in him all that are united to, and with him, in union with him, become his <hi>holy Temple</hi> alſo, as is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.

So He it is that <hi>makes a day wherein we may rejoyce,</hi> before God, and unto him, and <hi>be glad, binding with cords the ſacrifices to the horns of the Altar confeſſing and praiſing God in and by him,</hi> Pſal. 118.24, 27, 28. both the <hi>day of grace,</hi> the <hi>accepted time,</hi> and time of finding now; and the everlaſting Reſt, Sabbath, or holy day hereafter, we have in and by him: Yea, He is the Sabbath or Reſt for the Soul, which gives it reſt in its believing on him, and makes us ceaſing from our own works, attend on him, and reſt on him, to be made an holy ſanctified People to God in and by him: the <hi>reſt wherewith the weary Soul may be made to reſt,</hi> Iſa. 28.12. with 58.13.

It appertained to Godlineſs, or the right worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, that Men entred into <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, and gave up themſelves to be his People, avouching him for their God, and receiving the Token and Seal thereof, in being circumcized to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 10, 11 <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. And Chriſt the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Son of Man is <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a Covenant to the People;</hi> and they that cloſe with and cleave to him, are therein ſpiritually <hi>circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands,</hi> Philip. 3.3. and are taken into nighneſs with God, to be his Children, <hi>Heires of the World;</hi> being accepted and accounted righteous, and bleſſed of him; for, <hi>in him we are compleat, circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p n="5">5. There were alſo <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and Offerings required to make atonement for the ſins of the Worſhippers, and to teſtify their acknowledgment of his Soveraignty, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving admiſſion into his favourable preſence; whence that, <hi>Bring an Offering, and come into his Courts,</hi> Pſal. 96.8. But alas, we have nothing clean and fit to offer unto him, that may make us acceptable, we being <hi>unclean</hi> our ſelves, and <hi>all our righteouſneſs like a filthy ragg,</hi> Iſa. 64 6. and the inferiour Creatures are of a ſmall value, and he needs them not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.9, 12. much leſs can we by any ſervice of ours, or offering of them, make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for, or any expiation of our ſins againſt him. Chriſt therefore anſwers both to Sacrifices and Offerings, or Gifts; being the great propitiatory, atoning Sacrifice for us, beſides which there is none other, the perpetual abiding <hi>propitiation for our ſins, and for the ſins of the whole World,</hi> Heb. 1.3. and 9.26. and 10.5, 10. 1 Joh. 2.1.2. And <hi>he hath offered up himſelf a Sacrifice, and an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto God for us,</hi> Eph. 5.2. That by him and the vertues of his blood, and offering
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53764:183"/>
for us, we in our going to God might find acceptance; our ſins being there-through forgiven us, and liberty of approach given us to the Holy of Holies: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10, 14, 19, 20, 22.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There needed a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to offer the Sacrifices and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the People, and make the atonement, and both to obtain and pronounce the bleſſing of the Lord, for, and upon them; and to that purpoſe God choſe <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.6, 23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.8. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.13. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.3.8. But that Prieſthood is gone, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Son of man is the <hi>Prieſt in</hi> and <hi>great High Prieſt over the Houſe of God for ever, called of God an High Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedeck;</hi> and conſecrated by <hi>the Word of Gods oath</hi> thereto, as we ſhewed before, ſuch a Prieſt as we need, having both perfect power with God, and pity, and compaſſion towards us, and faithfulneſs towards both: yea, and He makes thoſe that cleave unto him, Prieſts to God too; <hi>a royal and holy Prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God by him,</hi> Rev. 5.10. 1 Pet. 2.5, 9. But He is over and among them <hi>the Great High Prieſt;</hi> his are the holy Veſtments <hi>the Breaſt-plate of judgment</hi> is upon his heart, whence all his actings with God for us, and from God with us, as the great high Prieſt and Mediator, are with exact judgment.

And by the Faith of him, are we ſanctified to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. Though as there the Altar could not ſanctifie any unclean thing forbidden by the Law, nor might it come thereon: So here we may not think to offer up any ſin, or what is in it ſelf ſinful, by retaining the corruption in it, to be ſanctified by Chriſt, but that that is made clean in him, and through his Word commanding or allowing it, and his Spirit ſpringing it up, and then the Pollutions thereto cleaving he takes away; as he himſelf was the <hi>ſpotleſs Lamb,</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to which was no Pollution adhering, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19.</p>

Surely that's the way for us alſo to be made an excellent and precious People in the ſight of God, and uſeful to and among men. For this alſo is of the Commendations of Chriſt, that his Excellencies and Preciouſneſs, communicate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute an Excellency to all in whom he is. It's his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, as we noted before, that renders the Goſpel a more excellent and glorious Doctrine; and ſo it's his Excellency and Preciouſneſs derived to them, that makes his People (thoſe that own and believe on him) to be a more excellent People then others; as it is ſaid, <hi>The Righteous is more excellent then his Neighbour,</hi> Prov. 12.26. it is becauſe Chriſt is in them; as it is ſaid again, <hi>God is in the Generation of the Juſt,</hi> Pſal. 14.5. And the <hi>Riches of the Myſtery of the Goſpel</hi> Preached among the Gentiles <hi>is Chriſt in</hi> (or among) <hi>them, the hope of Glory,</hi> Col. 1.27. As Chriſt alſo prayed for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that they <hi>may be one as the Father and Son are one; he</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>in them, and the Father in him,</hi> John 17.23. For as the <hi>Comelineſs of Jeruſalem,</hi> and her <hi>Beauty</hi> that was <hi>perfect,</hi> was ſo through <hi>his Beauty and Comelineſs, put upon her,</hi> Ezek. 16.14. So the Excellency of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is his Excellency put upon them; who are ſaid to have <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> and to be, as it were, clothed with him. Now he being ſo precious, how muſt they needs be alſo precious in and by him? And indeed, others who have not him, and much more they who reject and refuſe him, lifting up themſelves or other things, and glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, are <hi>vile perſons,</hi> Pſal. 15.4. For indeed, every thing or perſon according to the Spirit, is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of as it hath reference to, or hath more or leſs of, or conduceth more or leſs to our injoyment of him.

                  <hi>Motive</hi> 1. If we refuſe to look to, and behold him, how then ſhall we hereafter look upon him, when He comes in his glory, and calls us to an account, and when we muſt make a reckoning to Him of our doings? when He ſhall ſet before us, that God for our good and welfare, out of his abundant grace and mercy to us, gave him his only begotten Son, and He himſelf for us, and how He, through his great and heavy ſorrows and ſufferings, was exalted and lifted up for us, as an Object prepared to our hands, and every way ſufficient, able and ready to ſave, and heal us, and we after all that would not turn away our eyes from beholding vanity, to look upon and conſider Him ſuch a loving and lovely Object; an Object ſo fair and beautiful, ſo comely and glorious, both for eſcape, and for delight, for ſafety and life, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2) as He was and is to us! <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation,</hi> as was <hi>prepared before the face</hi> (and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the needs and wants) <hi>of all People,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and lifted up to us. If <hi>they that deſpiſed Moſes law dyed without mercy,</hi> (as we noted before) <hi>under two or three witneſſes, of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be counted worthy, that hath trampled under foot the Son of God</hi> (ſuch and ſo excellent a one, as we have ſeen before in part) <hi>counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, a common or unholy thing, and hath done deſpight to the ſpirit of grace, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 2.3. and 10.28, 29.

                  <hi>Motive</hi> 2. If we look to Him, the benefit will be great, for He will help and heal us at all turns. He is of vertue and force to heal our hearts, minds and conſciences in all caſes, as it was with the Brazen Serpent, what-ever were the ſtings and wounds received by the fiery Serpents in looking to the Serpent of Braſs, they were cured of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53764:191"/>
them: None of them were ſo ſlighty, as that they had any promiſe of living with them, without looking to that: nor any ſo deep and dangerous, but that in looking up to that they lived. So is it here: None ſo good, ſo holy, or ſo little ſinful, as that without looking to Chriſt, they may expect to be ſaved, and to have eternal life; nor are any ſo bad, or deſperately wicked, but in a hearty, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and timely looking to Chriſt, they may be healed, and live for ever. Let that then move us to look to him, as <hi>delivered up to Death for our offences, and raiſed again from the Dead for our Juſtification;</hi> glorified at the right hand of God, and lifted up in the Goſpel by the Holy Spirit, and in the exerciſe of the ſpiritual gifts of God's Servants, given them to that purpoſe; yea, in every caſe let us look to Him to be healed, and ſaved by Him; As for inſtance,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 1. Are we ſenſible of our ſins and ſinfulneſs, and ready to deſpair, becauſe they are ſo great and manifold! The way to be healed of ſuch wounds upon our hearts and conſciences; the fears, horrours, and ſmarts of ſuch ſtings, is to turn the eye hither, to the Son of man, the Lord Jeſus, not to pore upon our ſelves, our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, inability to ſatisfy Gods juſtice by any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, bewailings, confeſſions, or amendments of ours; nor to ſet our ſelves, as conceiting our ſelves able, to help or heal our ſelves by any ſuch courſes, or by any deviſes or contrivances of our own or others; as Plaiſters of our own making, or others commending, or giving; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mind, and look unto the perfect Law of Liberty, continuing to look thereinto, that we may ſee what He is; and what He hath done and ſuffered for us: what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction He hath given to juſtice; what Redemption He hath obtained; what Peace he hath made; what Pardon is Proclaimed in Him; for whom He hath ſuffered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to the Spirits teſtimony in the Scriptures, and to whom He proclaims and preaches Peace there-through; the greatneſs of his love, and freeneſs of his Grace to Man-kind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preached <hi>Chriſt</hi> to thoſe, who were <hi>prickt at their hearts,</hi> at their hearing, that they had been guilty of murthering <hi>Chriſt;</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to believe on Him, upon that account, that there was in Him remiſſion of ſins, and the Holy Ghoſt to be given them by him, and they looking to him, and yielding up to what He ſo looked to wrought in them were comforted and healed, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, 38, 41.

               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 2. In caſe of a benummedneſs of our ſpirits, through ſenſleſneſs of our vileneſs in our ſelves, or apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be puffed up with conceits of our wholeneſs, or
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:53764:192"/>
betterneſs then others, and thence a careleſneſs to ſeek for health to our Souls, the way to be convinced of our vileneſs and emptineſs, and ſo to be humbled and abaſed in our ſelves, is to look to, and upon Chriſt crucified, and behold his Croſs and Sufferings for us, as ſet forth in the Goſpel to us; that that's the beſt way to take down our pride, and bring us to a ſenſe of our wretchedneſs, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in that, the Apoſtle tells us, they judged <hi>all dead,</hi> from <hi>ones</hi> having <hi>dyed for all:</hi> The ſight of our deadneſs and helpleſneſs in our ſelves, is beſt ſeen in that Glaſs, that repreſents that Chriſt dyed for all, and ſo for us; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. Where alſo the ſight of his grace in dying for us, will cure our deadneſs, quicken and put life into us, ſo as to make us live; ſo that that ſight both kills and makes alive, wounds and heals; caſteth us down in our ſelves, and raiſeth us up in Chriſt, Crucifies us with Chriſt, and yet makes us live in him, and brings him in to live in us; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2 20. and ſo the Exalting, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and witneſſing to Chriſt, both <hi>throws down the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and fills up the Vallies,</hi> Iſa. 40.4. which was the work of the Baptiſt, bearing witneſs to the Light, and the effect wrought in them, who beheld and looked to the Light, witneſſed to by him, <hi>Luc.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 16. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8, 15, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many that cannot by the law be convinced of their loſtneſs in themſelves, and their need of Chriſt, by reaſon that they are ſtrict and zealous Obſervers and Performers of the Law in their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſo as that upon that account they judg themſelves righteous, may and muſt be ſeen to be naturally wretched ſinners, and to have need of Chriſt, in this that He dyed for them; if they look upon, and diſcern what is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them therein; yea, therein they may ſee the utter undonneſs of their ſtate, upon any other account, then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Death; where, together with the convincement

                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 3. In caſe of temptations from our inabilities, and inſufficiencies, to help our ſelves by freeing our ſelves from the defilement of our ſins, or getting victory over them, or ſaving our ſelves out of the ſnares of ſin, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, or working in our ſelves holineſs, and conformity to Chriſt, ſo as may fit us for his Kingdom and glory, our way is to <hi>look off,</hi> from,<note place="margin">

How he is appointed, and hath engaged to ſanctify, and waſh his Church, (that is, ſuch as cleave to, believe on, and obey him) and to bring forth Judgment into Victory, ſubduing their Enemies, and treading Sathan under their Feet: And how faithful and powerful He is for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his engagements: This is the way, I ſay, to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſuch temptations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. and 3.1, 2. And the like we may ſay for temptations, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his appearing ſlowneſs, in performing his promiſes, our finding no more deliverance from any ſinful diſtempers, and temptations to ſin, and from the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of other enemies; as <hi>Abraham</hi> was helped, and <hi>Sarah</hi> alſo againſt temptations, from Gods not making more haſt to perform his promiſes, by conſidering God's Power and Faithfulneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17, 18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11, 12. Yea,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 4. Would we be delivered from the power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and ſin, occaſioning barrenneſs and temptation, or otherwiſe prevailing over, and polluting us! This is our way to get freedom from, and victory over them; even the eying of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of Man, for its the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and which He himſelf
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53764:193"/>
is that <hi>makes free from</hi> the ſervice of Sin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32, 34, 35, 36. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 20, 21, 22, 23. and it's the beholding <hi>his glory with open face, as in a Glaſs,</hi> in which we may be <hi>transformed into his Image and likeneſs, from glory to glory, as by his Spirit:</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. His Word and Faith it is that ſanctifies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 5. In caſe of Perſecutions, or Chaſtiſements from God, or any troubles and afflictions here befalling us; <hi>Look to Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of the Faith, who for the Joy ſet before Him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſed the ſhame, and is now ſet down on the right hand of the Throne of God.</hi> And, this will preſerve us from being weary of Gods cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, or fainting under the contradiction of ſinners; partly while we there ſee how Chriſt ſuffered the like or greater for us and hath thereby taken away the evil and deſtructiveneſs of them from us; and partly while we ſee how He is impowered, and is faithful and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to help us under them, and bring us out of them. He being as well the <hi>Finiſher,</hi> as the <hi>Author of the Faith;</hi> and ſet down on <hi>the Throne of Majeſty,</hi> as one inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the fulneſs of the power of God to help us; and alſo appearing there to make Interceſſion for us; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2, 6. and 7, 24, 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 6. Would we ſee the odiouſneſs of ſin, that we might abhor, and beware of it? Behold the Son of man ſuffering for it on our behalf! ſee the Agonies, Perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, Shame, Reproaches, Death and Curſe it brought upon Him. There we may ſee <hi>Sin condemned in the Fleſh;</hi> Rom. 8.3. and 6.3, 4. Having dyed to it there, how ſhould we again live in it? ſhould we not ceaſe from that, for which in Chriſt we have ſuffered in the fleſh, and muſt have ſuffered for it in our fleſh, even in our ſouls
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53764:193"/>
and bodies for our ſelves, had not he ſuffered for it? yea, and muſt yet ſuffer for ever, if through the ſight of his Grace, we turn not from it; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. and 4.1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 7. Would we ſee the hainouſneſs of neglecting Chriſt, and the grace of God in him, or of ſinning againſt him, after the knowledge of him received? The way for it, is to behold and mind what He hath done for us, and to us; that He is <hi>the Son of God,</hi> whom we <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under foot</hi> therein; that He is the <hi>Lord that bought</hi> us, whom we therein <hi>deny;</hi> that it's his <hi>precious blood, the blood of the Covenant,</hi> by which He procured a gracious Covenant of great and precious promiſes to be made for us, and confirmed and ratified it, and <hi>the blood wherewith we are ſanctified,</hi> and rendred meet to have liberty, and acceſs to, and acceptance with God, that is therein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned by us, that its the <hi>ſpirit</hi> that diſcovers his <hi>grace,</hi> and is of his great grace ſent forth to call and cleanſe us, that is, <hi>deſpited</hi> by us; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. That they are <hi>his Members,</hi> who is the Chriſt, and his <hi>Temple;</hi> who hath <hi>bought us with a great price</hi> for himſelf, that are <hi>defiled</hi> by us; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 8. Would we ſee the emptineſs of all our own righteouſneſs, that we do or could do for our ſelves, for making our peace with God, and obtaining his favour, and acceptance? Behold Chriſt crucified, as ſet forth in the Goſpel, and that declares it, and that it will not profit us: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.12. for, if <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> be, or could have been that way obtained, then <hi>Chriſt died in vain;</hi> but, that may not be ſuppoſed, therefore no other <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> could avail us, but He to be our righteouſneſs, through his Death and Sacrifice; no Law could give life to us; none but Chriſt crucified for us; upon which account it
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53764:194"/>
was, that the Apoſtle cryed out ſo of the folly and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchedneſs of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> who having had <hi>Jeſus Chriſt evidently ſet forth among them,</hi> as <hi>crucified for them;</hi> yet would turn to <hi>beggerly obſervations,</hi> to ſeek to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1, 21. with 2.21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe</hi> 9. Would we ſee our duties either to God or men, what's meet to be performed by us, and how ſhort we are in anſwering his engagements upon us? Behold the Son of man, and mind the teachings of his grace, bringing ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to us, obtaining by his death and ſufferings all the freedome from miſery and curſe, and all the enjoyment of the good things vouchſafed to us, and what is alſo for the future ſet in hope before us; yea, for ever, and then we ſhall ſee our ſelves bound <hi>to live to him that dyed for us, and roſe again,</hi> and to <hi>offer up to God our bodies a living Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, holy and acceptable,</hi> and that that's a <hi>reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> to him, that it behoves us to enquire and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his will, as our lawful Lord, by vertue of his Death, Reſurrection, and Reviving again for us, and that we ought <hi>to glorify him both in body and ſpirit,</hi> as being his purchaſe; and ſo to uſe all freedomes, mercies and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with all ſobriety, righteouſneſs and godlineſs, that we may in nothing diſhonour or diſſerve him, but glorify him in all things, <hi>looking</hi> after and waiting <hi>for</hi> (giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that we may be found worthy of) <hi>the bleſſed hope</hi> ſet before us, and to be revealed at his appearance, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1, 2. and 14.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18, 19, 20. and the looking upon, and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords body as crucified for us, and given to be the Bread of Life to us, is the beſt way to examine our ſelves, and diſcern our defects and evils, and to judge our ſelves accordingly for them, that we may not be judged by Him: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:53764:194"/>
                  <hi>Caſe,</hi> 10. Would we be quickned up in our duties, and way of ſeeking for, and ſerving the Lord, and not faint therein, or be ſlothful, or tired out through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements? The way is, to behold and look upon the Son of man lifted up, for, and before us; that we may <q>caſt away every weight, and the ſin that ſo eaſily beſets us, and run with patience the race ſet before us; look to Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of the Faith.</q> There we may ſee his Example and Pattern, and alſo both Ingagement from his Love to us as the <hi>Author,</hi> and hope of both ſucceſs, and of an infinite recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as the <q>Finiſher of the Faith ſet down on the Right-hand of Majeſty, that may make us <hi>gird up the loyns of our minds,</hi> and run with Patience and Courage, hoping perfectly for the Grace to be brought in at his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as obedient Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe,</hi> 11. Would we be recovered from any Relapſes and Decays to our former Strength, and be helped to go forward in Chriſt Jeſus? Our way is to look upon the Son of man, and therein to look to him for healing Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: Thus the Apoſtles ſets Chriſt Crucified, and the Grace in him before the <hi>Galatians;</hi> when he was in fear of them to recover them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14, 16. and 4.4, 5, 6. and 5.1. And ſo Chriſt ſets himſelf before the declining Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> wiſhing him to remember, call to mind, look back upon what he was fallen from: <q>Remember whence thou art fallen, and repent,</q> 
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5. And ſo to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Sardis, Dead, while he had a Name to Live;</hi> he preſents himſelf as <hi>he that hath the ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> and ſo Power to Revive him; and as one that <q>holds the ſeven Stars in his Right-hand, ſignifying his love to, and care of his Servants, and yet power to do
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53764:195"/>
his pleaſure with them; and wiſhes him to remember or look back upon how he had received, and heard, and to hold faſt,</q> 
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. And to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> grown <hi>Luke-warm,</hi> and in danger to <q>be ſpewed out of his mouth</q>; he preſents himſelf as <q>the Amen, the faithful and true Witneſs</q> (to quicken up his zeal in minding the firmneſs of his Promiſes, and truth of his Reproofs) and that he is the <q>beginning of the Creation of God</q>, to mind him of his Power and Ability to ſtabliſh him, or give being as he pleaſes to him; and after declaration of his miſery, ſets before him, and directs his Eye to behold his Riches, Fulneſs and Freeneſs, and <hi>to buy of him</hi> what he wanted; and his Love and Patience, in <hi>Rebuking, Correcting,</hi> and <hi>ſtanding</hi> with patience <hi>at the door knocking,</hi> and waiting for admiſſion; and his readineſs to come in, and Feaſt with men, upon their hearing and opening to him And to him, as to all the reſt, he preſents his Love, Power, and Faithfulneſs to Reward them that overcome, and the greatneſs of the Rewards he will give them, to Cure or Incourage them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.14, 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe,</hi> 12. Would we be directed to, and quickened up in the Love of God, and of one another, or Charity to the World of Mankind, yea, or to our Enemies? Our way is to behold the Son of man as lifted up for, and to us; for there we may ſee his love to God his Father, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his Life on the Croſs in obedience to him, as a perfect pattern for our imitation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>John</hi> 14.31. and the Love both of God and of Chriſt to us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17. and 4.9, 10. able to move our hearts to love him again, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. Yea, both his Love to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 14. and 15.9, 10. as an example and motive to us, to love them that are his Diſciples, and our Brethren, <hi>John</hi> 13.34, 35. and 15.12. And
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53764:195"/>
his Love to thoſe who were ignorant of him, loſt and periſhing, as an example to us to love ſuch, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as we our ſelves were ſuch, to love ſuch alſo with a love of compaſſion; yea, ſuch as are ſtrangers from us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6 10. Yea, his Love to his Enemies is an Example and Motive to us, to love to our capacities our enemies alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44, 45. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. Yea, in this lifting up this Son of man by his Spirit, is alſo the Preſence and Efficacy of his Spirit as a <hi>Spirit of love,</hi> to infuſe love into us, and frame us to love, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7, 8. Yea,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſe,</hi> 13. Would we be furniſhed with any Virtue, and framed to, and directed in any good way? Look hither and behold Chriſt Crucified for us, and lifted up there-through for, and to us; and here we may find Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Inducement, and Spirit, to inable and frame the heart thereto. Yea, in moſt things, if not in all Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Example thereof, as to ſay: <hi>In Bowels of Mercy,</hi> behold his mercifulneſs to us, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.37. and 10.37. <hi>In kindneſs,</hi> Tit. 3.4. <hi>In humbleneſs of mind,</hi> Phil. 2.5, 6, 7. <hi>In meekneſs and lowlineſs,</hi> Mat. 11.29. <hi>In gentleneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.1. <hi>In long-ſuffering,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. and 1 Pet. 2.21, 22. <hi>In forbearance and forgiveneſs,</hi> Col. 3.13.14. <hi>In patient</hi> putting up of wrongs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 21, 22, 23.

out of his hand and drinking the Cup he gave him; to propoſe to our ſelves, and imitate in looking upon him, <hi>John</hi> 18.11. So alſo looking upon him as lifted up for, and before us, we ſhall ſee cauſe to be ſubmiſſive to God therein. For was it not more for God to give his Son for us, and expoſe him to ſuch Sufferings and Death, then to take away a Son or a Daughter, a Wife or a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or a Friend from us? Seeing alſo by his Sons death he hath made a way through Death, to better injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and greater happineſs, then they could have here in this life; and hath given to his Son through his death, <hi>the Keys of hell and death,</hi> to bring or keep out from Death, as he pleaſes.

                  </gap> The looking to him is the way to have our underſtandings inlightned into all Truth, our minds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, our hearts cleanſed, comforted, healed, filled with peace, joy, hope, and every good fruit; our Souls ſaved from all evil of ſin, both guilt, filth, ſnare and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and from the pollutions of the World, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan, and ſo from every evil thing; and our whole Converſation rightly ordered.

Oh therefore let us in all caſes, and at all times, look to him, and wiſtly behold and view him; and to that purpoſe, Oh let us with <hi>David,</hi> make it the one thing deſired by us, <hi>That we may dwell in his houſe,</hi> and be always <hi>beholding the fair Beauty of the Lord, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring in his holy Temple,</hi> Pſal. 27.4. Seeing alſo,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive,</hi> 3. There is nothing elſe that we can turn to, or look upon, that can or will do any of theſe things for and in us; no Law or Doctrine if this be rejected and put away, or that is beſide, or ſwarveth from this; no work, frame, or device of our own or others; no Plaiſter, Medicine, or Courſe we can take, will heal us in any thing ſo as to better our conditions. For ſure if <hi>Moſes</hi> Law will not do it which was given from God himſelf (the exacteſt and beſt that ever was given beſide) then much leſs will any humane Laws or Injunctions, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, Works, Ceremonies, Practices of our own or others; but if we turn from this Object, <hi>we muſt needs
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53764:197"/>
go after vain things, and things that cannot profit us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are vain:</hi> And though we may <hi>kindle fires</hi> to our ſelves, and <hi>compaſs our ſelves with ſparks, and walk in the light of our own fire, yet we muſt periſh and lie down in ſorrow,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.19, 20, 21. Iſa. 50.11. Yea, though we ſet any Precepts or Ordinances of Chriſt before us to obſerve and practiſe, yet if we obſerve and practiſe them without ſeeing and looking to him, and ſo believing and depending on him for wiſdom, Strength, and Bleſſing, we ſhall deceive our ſelves, and do like them that made the Word of the Lord to themſelves, <hi>Precept upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, Precept upon precept; Line upon line, Line upon line; here a little, and there a little,</hi> neglecting the <hi>viſion of All,</hi> the <hi>Foundation and Reſt, wherewith the weary ſhould be cauſed to reſt,</hi> Iſa. 28.12, 13, 16. and 29.11. They that ſo do are ſo far from being healed and ſaved in, and by ſuch ways, that they fall under reproof, as taking the wrong courſe for themſelves, becauſe not looking to (yea, are under greater miſery and judgment for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſpiſing) this healing Object.</p>
               <p>Theſe things then being conſidered, let us be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to look off from other things as vain and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as being neither Crucified for us, nor having a Name, Power, and Virtue, able to afford Relief to us: Yea, oftentimes bewitching of and deſtructive to us (as the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil was to <hi>Evah,</hi> and the Wedg of Gold, and Babyloniſh Garment proved to <hi>Achan</hi>) and to look to Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of the Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, let us look to him in all caſes, for all things, in all means, at all times, and with all diligence and perſeverance. I ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us look to him in all caſes, for all Grace and Bleſſing needful for us. As to ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For pardon of our ſins; for in him is <hi>forgiveneſs
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53764:197"/>
of ſin Preached to us, and to him give all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. as we noted before in ſpeaking to the believing on him, to be exerciſed by us. It is not for us to pore upon our ſelves, and ſins, and think that way to get rid of them without looking to him, in believing on him: Nor is it for us to run to other Means or Medicines, or truſt to any Popes or Prieſts to pardon us, but look to him directly as our only Saviour, that having Suffered and Died for our ſins, hath there-through both Power and Readineſs to forgive them, and ſo we ſhall receive it of, and in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us look to him for cleanſing from the filth of our ſins; For he is filled with Spirit and Power to that purpoſe, the <hi>Spirit of the fear of the Lord is upon him,</hi> to inable and furniſh him to frame our hearts to fear him; and in his Mediating and Miniſtring the New Teſtament, or Covenant, he <hi>puts the fear of God into the heart</hi> which is <hi>clean,</hi> and leads to <hi>cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and of the ſpirit, and to perfect holineſs before him,</hi> Jer. 32.39, 40. with Heb. 8.6.10. Pſal. 19.9. 2 Cor. 7.1. And to that purpoſe look we to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For Light and Direction in the Truth of God as it is in him, and to receive from him that Unction by which we may know all things, and be lead into all truth. That Light that will guide our feet into the Paths of Peace at all times, and in all caſes; for <hi>He is come a Light into the World, that whoſoever believeth on him, might not abide in darkneſs,</hi> John 12.46. And he <hi>Will bring forth Judgment to the Gentiles, and cauſe his Judgment to reſt for a Light to the people,</hi> Iſa. 42.1. and 51.4. <hi>They look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him and were enlightned, and their faces were not aſhamed,</hi> Pſal. 34.5. All others are <hi>vanity,</hi> and <hi>their works wind and confuſion;</hi> none of them (where he is not) can anſwer any thing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.28, 29. Let us look to
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53764:198"/>
him for direction in our ways, as well as for inſtruction to our minds; that we may know and underſtand his will concerning us, in what he requires of us, as well as what he is, and hath done for us; for he is the <hi>Counſellor</hi> to Action and Practice, as well as the <hi>Teacher</hi> of us in Faith and Doctrine; and <hi>he will teach us his ways,</hi> that we <hi>may walk in his paths,</hi> Iſa. 2.3. It's good to ſeek to him both in matters of Faith and Practice, and not to lean to our own underſtandings, nor take things on truſt from men ſimply on the account of their Authority or Wiſdom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For Spirit and Grace to incline our hearts to believe on him, and walk in his ways: For the Spirit is put upon him, and he is the <hi>Baptizer with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> John 1.33. which he <hi>gives to them that obey him,</hi> Acts 5.32. Thus we find <hi>David</hi> looking to him (for by Lord, he oft-times ſignified the Son, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.1.5.7. and 68.17, 18, 19. and 102.12.25. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6.10, 11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8.11.) for the holy Spirit, and for its inclining his heart to his fear and way: Witneſs theſe and the like Expreſſions, <hi>Uphold me with thy free Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 51.11. <hi>Thy Spirit is good, lead me into the Land of uprightneſs,</hi> Pſal. 143.10. <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy Commandments, incline my heart unto thy Teſtimonies, and not to Covetouſneſs; turn away mine eyes from beholding Vanity; quicken me in thy ways,</hi> Pſal. 119.35, 36, 37.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Look we alſo to him; For ſtrength to ſtrengthen us unto every good way and work, and to uphold us in all difficulties, and againſt all oppoſitions; for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that is upon him, is as well a Spirit of <hi>Might,</hi> as of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Counſel,</hi> Iſa. 11.2. And the holy Men of God have looked to him for ſtrength both unto all good; ſo <hi>David, In the day when I cried unto thee, thou ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt me with ſtrength in my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 138.3. <hi>Strengthen me
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53764:198"/>
according to thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119.28. And againſt all evil and oppoſition; as, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>phold me according to thy word, that I may live, and let me not be aſhamed of my hope; hold thou me up, and I ſhall be ſafe,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 119.116, 117. And ſo its promiſed, that they who wait on the Lord, the Lord will <hi>ſtrengthen their hearts,</hi> and they <hi>ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up as with wings like Eagles, they ſhall run and not be a weary, walk and not faint,</hi> Pſal. 27.14. and 31.24. Iſa. 40.29, 30, 31.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For comfort in Diſtreſſes, Troubles, and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. For its he that <hi>prays the Father</hi> for, and obtains and <hi>ſends the Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth,</hi> John 14.16, 17. and 15.26. And in his ſeeing his people, or viſiting them with his Salvation, he makes their hearts rejoyce, ſo as their joy ſhall no man take from them, <hi>John</hi> 16.22. Thus <hi>David</hi> looked up to the Lord for comfort, <hi>When wilt thou comfort me,</hi> Pſal. 119.82. and <hi>When wilt thou come to me,</hi> Pſal. 101.2. And <hi>Rejoyce the ſoul of thy Servant, for unto thee do I lift up my ſoul, O Lord,</hi> Pſal. 86.4. But in looking to him for this and all other things, take we heed to love him, and keep his Commandments, as our Saviour inſtructs us, <hi>John</hi> 14.15, 16, 21.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For help and ſuccour in dangers, and deliverance from evils, and from all enemies, whether they be men or Devils: For <hi>all Power and Authority in Heaven and upon Earth</hi> is his, and <hi>he ſtands and feeds (or rules) in the ſtrength of the Lord, and in the Majeſty of his Name;</hi> and is both <hi>mighty to ſave</hi> his Servants, and <hi>to deſtroy his</hi> and their enemies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.1. <hi>James</hi> 4.12. Thus <hi>David, Mine eyes are evermore to the Lord, for he ſhall pluck my feet out of the Net,</hi> Pſal. 25.15. And when he had in vain looked for refuge to other things, and they failed him, then he looked to the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53764:199"/>
Lord for refuge, who never fails them that ſeeks him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4, 5. and 9.10. For indeed, in vain is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation either in Grace unto Glory, or from Enemies, as Sin, Satan, and their Inſtruments or Deſigns looked for from any thing elſe; and therefore it's good to look to the Lord, in whom alone is our Salvation, and to wait for him the God of Salvation, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.7. Yea, in a word,</p>
               <p n="8">8. Look to him for all Grace and Bleſſing, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this Life and of the Life to come: <hi>For in him all the Promiſes of God are, Yea, and Amen, to the Glory of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. And he is the <hi>God of all Grace,</hi> all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelling bodily in him; the Fountain of Living Waters, who gives freely and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and upbraids no man. Look therefore for the Mercy of this our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (even for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hope, and his glorious appearance) unto Eternal life, <hi>Jude</hi> 21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. And look we to him for all this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In all means. As to ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In minding his Word, and looking into that <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law of Liberty,</hi> as it is called, <hi>James</hi> 1.26. There he is exerciſing his Spiritual power, and affording his help, that being <hi>Spirit and Life,</hi> Rom. 1.16. John 6.63. A <hi>Miniſtration of Spirit,</hi> that quickens and gives Life, Strength, and Grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. And <hi>gives Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>makes wiſe the ſimple,</hi> Pſal. 19.9. and 119 130. Yea, as it is written, <hi>The holy Scriptures are able to make a man wiſe to Salvation, through Faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. And <hi>he that hath the Doctrine of Chriſt</hi> in his heart, ſo as to Believe, Mind, Love, and Obey it <hi>hath Chriſt,</hi> nay, <hi>both Father and Son,</hi> 2 John. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. There he is Diſcovered, Pourtraied or ſet forth, ſo as there-through we may ſee what an One he is, and behold his Grace and Glory with open face as in a
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53764:199"/>
Glaſs, through the help of his Spirit, as is ſignified, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Look upon him there therefore, and there wait on, and for him. And with this,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In meditating on him as there ſet forth, muſing on, and pondering his words, and on him, as declared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. So it's ſaid, <hi>Kings ſhall ſhut their mouths at him, for what they had not been told ſhall they ſee, and what they had not heard ſhall they conſider,</hi> Iſa. 52.15. They ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or mind with themſelves; namely, as looking herein and conſidering them as Preached in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; for unto that the Apoſtle applies it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.21. Spiritual meditation being as it were an inward Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and wiſter looking into the Law of Liberty, and upon him as ſet forth therein: <hi>My meditations of thee ſhall be ſweet,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 104.34.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In Praying to him, and to God in and through him: Then we <hi>lift up our faces to him,</hi> Job 22.26. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man may <hi>ſee his Face</hi> oft-times <hi>with joy,</hi> lifting up pure hearts and hands to him, <hi>Job</hi> 33.26. In Prayer, we both look up to him and upon him, fixing the eyes of our mind upon him; we lift <hi>up our eyes unto,</hi> and our <hi>eyes are upon the Lord our God, till he have mercy on us,</hi> Pſal. 123.1, 2. There we are to take notice of, and know his Name in calling upon it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.14, 15. Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing Faith (which is the exerciſe of the eyes of the mind alſo to behold, as well as of the hand to lay hold of him) in him and his Name, otherwiſe it's not a <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> as it ſhould be, and as it's called, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In his Sacraments or Ordinances of Communion together with him. In Baptiſm, we may <hi>behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the ſins of the world,</hi> John 1.29. And in the Supper we have to do with his Body and Blood, and his Death ſhewed forth therein, it being
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53764:200"/>
                  <hi>a Communion of his Body and Blood,</hi> held forth there to be taken notice of by us, and received of us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. and 11.26. And for, and in all theſe, it's good to look to him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the Unity of the Spirit with his people, and in Fellowſhip with them, in his Houſe, his Church, his Temple, thoſe that have his Name upon them, and with them: <hi>Many people ſhall ſay, Come ye, and let us go up to the Mountain of the Houſe of the Lord, to the Houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his Ways,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 2.3. And, <hi>Oh how good is it for Brethren to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in unity, for there the Lord commandeth the Bleſſing, even life for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 133.1.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Look we to him, and upon him at all times. Hear <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> for that's implied in that the Word is to be Preached in ſeaſon, and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. for there is no Preaching but to ſome hearers; meditate on him as ſet forth in it, <hi>night and day,</hi> Pſal. 1.2. whether literally underſtood, for ſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Seven times a day will I praiſe thee,</hi> Pſal. 119.164. <hi>Conſider my meditation, in the morning will I direct it unto thee, and will look,</hi> Pſal. 5.1, 3.

Or Metaphorically, for times of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Adverſity, <hi>when we are merry,</hi> beholding his Goodneſs ſet forth in his Word, or proved in his Works. The Word of Chriſt dwelling in us, will lead us to <hi>ſing Pſalms;</hi> and <hi>when ſad</hi> and heavy, then conſidering in the day of Adverſity him that is able to help us, <hi>Pray, Col,</hi> 3.16. with <hi>James</hi> 5.13. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. Yea, that we may <hi>Bleſs him at all times, and his praiſe be continually in our mouth;</hi> it's needful that the thought of Him and his Name, and ſo the Conſideration and Contemplation of him, be always habitually in our hearts, <hi>That out of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53764:200"/>
the abundance of the heart the mouth may ſpeak, and we may out of the good treaſure there bring forth good things,</hi> Pſal. 34.1, 2. and 145.1, 2. Mat. 12.34, 35.</p>
               <p n="4">4. With all earneſtneſs and ſerious diligence, even <hi>with the whole heart,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.13. for this is not a matter of ſport and divertiſement only from ſome weightier matters; but the main and chief thing of all our whole lives: Matth. 6.33. <hi>The one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> or neceſſary, <hi>Luc.</hi> 10.42. to be looking up to, and upon the Lord Jeſus; therefore the <hi>one thing deſired</hi> by <hi>David, to dwell in his Houſe, that he might behold the fair beauty of the Lord;</hi> as was noted before, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. The things of greateſt moment depending hereupon; as to ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The deliverance of our Souls from the ſtings and venome of the old Serpent, even from ſin and death, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual death, and guilt, and filth now, and everlaſting curſe and miſery hereafter; And is this a thing to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled in, and dallied with! Is there any thing of ſo great danger to us, as to dye of thoſe wounds, and to fall into everlaſting miſery and perdition? and therefore is there any thing more ſeriouſly to be looked after, then that we may eſcape it? Would not men with the whole heart fly from the biting of Serpents, or the devouring teeth of Lyons, or Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven, as <hi>Lot</hi> did; or the Earths opening its mouth, as the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, when it ſwallowed up <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram?</hi> Oh how ſhould theſe worſe deſtructions of the Soul be much more heartily fled from? Would we be in earneſt, or dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and trifle, when labouring of the Gout or Stone, or Strangury, we look out for deliverance from them? And ſhall we not much more ſeriouſly look for deliverance from Hell and deſtruction, eternal wrath, and everlaſting burnings, which are infinitely worſe, and not to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:53764:201"/>
but by looking diligently, that we fail not of Gods grace? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The fitting us for any, or all acceptable ſervice to God, and profit to men; we cannot ſerve him acceptably, pleaſe him and profit others, till looking to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace and fitneſs; And is it nothing to pleaſe God? Seeing thence alſo flows,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The attaining to that perfectly, healthy ſtate of Soul, (and Body too in the Reſurrection) in which we ſhall have the greateſt and fulleſt happineſs, and that for ever; <hi>Fulneſs of joy in Gods preſence, and pleaſures at his right hand for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. Will men trifle in ſeeking health and life, much more in offers made of Crowns and Kingdomes, with all the confluence of riches, honours, and delights therein? I trow not; and if they that ſtrive for Maſteries, that they might get corruptible Crowns, wreaths of honour, much more Crowns of Gold, and Kingdomes would be temperate in all things, and endure all kind of hardſhips and labours for them; how much more ought we to be diligent, and do, and endure all things for an incorruptible Crown of ſuch infinite worth and value, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25, 26, 27. I read of <hi>Socrates,</hi>

Oh that we may not be ſo effeminate, and impatient of trouble and labour, as to let every, or any thing divert or turn us away from looking unto, and upon Chriſt crucified for us; which leads to the laſt particular: <hi>viz.</hi> Let us look to him,</p>
               <p n="5">5. With patient continuance and perſeverance; for, its <hi>He that continueth looking into the perfect Law of Liberty,

and is not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, that is,</hi> and ſhall be, <hi>bleſſed in his doing,</hi> Jam. 1.25, 26. <hi>The back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own ways, but the good man</hi> (that continues ſo) <hi>ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf,</hi> with what he drinks in namely from Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14.

                  <hi>Motive</hi> 4. I ſhall add to all this one other Motive to perſwade to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the reaſonableneſs and ſmalneſs of the thing required to ſo great advantages; its but look up, and be healed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Look to me and be ye ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> Iſa. 45.22. <hi>Hear and your Souls ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55.3. <hi>Open thine eyes, and thou ſhalt be ſatisfied with bread,</hi> Prov. 20.3. May not that man be juſtly left to ſtarve, or pine for want of proviſions, that for opening his eyes and looking about him diligently, might have enough to maintain him, and will not? and that man juſtly periſh, that in looking to Chriſt may be ſaved, and refuſes it? We may apply to ſuch as ſtick at this, and turn from it, what was ſaid to <hi>Naaman</hi> by his Servants; <hi>If the Prophet had bid thee do ſome great thing, wouldſt thou not have done it? how much more, when he ſaith waſh and be clean?</hi> 2 King. 5.13.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Exhort. </seg>2</label> ANd ſeeing the Son of man muſt be lift up, as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, that whoſoever believeth on him may not periſh, but have Eternal Life; and this lifting up is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of men, as Inſtruments in Gods and his Spirits hands, as to the lifting him up by way of commending him, and ſetting forth his vertues, as hath been more largely opened; let us conſidering diligently what hath been ſaid in Explication hereof, both in love to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with God in his bleſſed appointment herein; and in love to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> this moſt precious one, as being moſt worthy of all poſſible love and teſtimonies of it from us, being in the Name of God the Author and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer of all good for us, and Diſpenſer of it to us; and in love to the Souls and Perſons of our Neighbours and Brethren, to whom our love is pleaſing in the ſight of God and Chriſt, if duly teſtified by us. Let us, I ſay, eyeing and looking ſtedfaſtly upon him, and unto him for help and guidance, ſtrength and bleſſing, herein make it our buſineſs to lift up and extol this Son of man with all our skill and power: Knowing that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 1. Herein we ſhall do the will of God, and therein alſo not darken and obſcure, but greatly commend and lift up God himſelf; for this being his device and deſign, the iſſue, off-ſpring, and product of his infinite
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:53764:202"/>
Wiſdom, Holineſs, Grace, and Goodneſs, and He his only begotten Son, in whom is all his delight and well pleaſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in lifting him up we extol his wiſdom and holineſs, grace and goodneſs, and in neglecting or diſhonouring him or calling him Anathema, we abrogate the grace, and reject the wiſdom and counſel of God; give him the lye, and moſt horribly diſhonour him, as if a God of no judgment or underſtanding. <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that hath ſent him,</hi> Joh. 5.23. Who <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man himſelf</hi> [immediately] <hi>but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all ſhould honour him, as they do the Father that ſent him:</hi> And ſurely if we ſhew our ſelves ſo unkind to God and Chriſt, if we be ſo oppoſite to his <hi>Grand Deſign</hi> and undertaking, we muſt needs fall under the heat and weight of his indignation, and there will be no eſcaping it. But in lifting him up and honouring him, if we do it in deed and in truth, with our hearts, as well us with our lips, we pleaſe God, and have fellowſhip with him, as co-workers with, and under him; we are ſubject to his Spirit: and <hi>ſowing thereto we ſhall reap</hi> a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, even <hi>life everlaſting,</hi> Gal. 6.8. Rom. 6.19. And indeed God will accept of no praiſes or commendations of him from us, in which we neglect and lay by his Son, the Son of man, (according to the meaſures of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation given us of him) ſeem our praiſes and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him never ſo glorious. The Phariſees would have had the blind man give the glory of his ſeeing to God, ſo as to detract it from the Son of man, as a ſinner out of envy and oppoſition to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.24. But were they accepted, think you, in ſuch a pretended glorifying of God; Surely no: Nor yet thoſe zealous Phariſees and <hi>Jews,</hi> who being zealous of God, but not according to knowledge, through <hi>ignorance of Gods righteouſneſs, went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and ſubmitted not to
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:53764:203"/>
the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus: the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believes,</hi> Rom. 10.1, 2, 3, 4. and no better, but rather worſe be thoſe Antichriſtian ſpirits, who taking offence at the Croſs of Chriſt, and lifting up themſelves above it, not holding the head, do talk of God and Spirit, but ſo as they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs not Chriſt come in the Fleſh,</hi> but through their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him after the fleſh, and ignorance of him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirit of God, lay him by, as an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing, or thing out of date, as much as the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 2. Herein we ſhall be profitable to men, to whom we lift him up; that being the way to do them good, and bring them in to believe, and ſo to be ſaved from deſtruction, and be made partakers of eternal life; And what can we do better for them, then to be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſo great good to them? Indeed, this is the way to be profitable to them in every thing; for, if we be means of bringing them to Chriſt, and planting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, then are we means of their being made apt and fit for doing that which is good, and well-pleaſing in the ſight of God, in all things. It being the only thing that puts Men into a ſound, and right plight, both towards God and men; and then, we are means too of their being made able to bear, and endure all kinds of tryals and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes profitably, which may befall them: Yea, this is the way to make them live both comfortably and acceptably to God, and to dy in the favour of God, and ſo to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for ever: There is nothing then wherein we can be more friends to men, or more beneficial to them, then in a due lifting up the Son of man before them in word and converſation; therefore it is that God calls upon us ſo frequently, to praiſe, bleſs, exalt and magnify the Lord,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53764:203"/>
even <hi>Jehovah;</hi> which Title or Name is attributed to the Lord Jeſus alſo. And he muſt needs be included in the object of that act, inaſmuch as God accepts not of our praiſes to him, but in and through him, as was ſhewed before, eſpecially the <hi>Servants of the Lord, who ſtand in the Houſe, or Courts of the Lord,</hi> they are called upon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt, lift up, or <hi>praiſe the Lord, or the Name of the Lord;</hi> Pſal. 134.1, 2. and 135.1, 2, 3. And they are they that are chiefly ſet in the World to be Inſtruments of good to, and in it; and this is the way in which they are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, to do Men good; even by praiſing and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord to them, as we might conſider, in viewing particulars, how all their ſervice, in the Houſe of the Lord, and in the World, is to be done with this Engine or Inſtrument, the praiſing or lifting up the Lord, the Son of man; As for inſtance,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance</hi> 1. Would we convince the World of Sin, for not believing on Chriſt? the way of the Holy Spirit is to do it by witneſſing of him; lifting him up, and ſetting him forth, as the object to be believed on, the Chriſt, the Saviour; the Son of God that hath dyed for them, and is riſen again; this preſently pricks them at the heart, as it did thoſe in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36, 37. at the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preaching, and till Men ſee, and be convinced that He is ſuch a one, they think not themſelves guilty in reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, ſeeking ſafety and happineſs in the works of the Law, or ſome other things; till <hi>Paul</hi> ſee that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was ſuch a Perſon, He was ſo far from thinking, that He ſinned in not believing on him, that He thought <hi>He ought to do many things againſt his name,</hi> Act. 26.9. But, when he came to perceive who he was, then he was convinced of ſin in that, and judged himſelf for it ever after, as unworthy therefore of ſuch mercy, as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9.

                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. This then is our way to convince men of ſin, for their unbelief on Chriſt; let them ſee that He is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, and appointed of God to be their Saviour, their only Saviour, that He hath dyed for them, and is riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and is every way able and ready to ſave them, and therefore is to be looked to, and to be believed on, for all grace and bleſſing, and then they who thought before, that they might not believe on, and hope in him, they are ſo bad and unworthy, will ſee its their ſin not to believe on him; and that that is a greater evil then all their ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; as binding them all upon them, and hindering them from receiving the pardon of them, they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of other ſins by the Law, as Murther, Adultery, Theft, &amp;c. But not of this, that they ſin in not coming to Chriſt, and depending on him for all grace and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but in his being lifted up, and evidenced to be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and glorious an one: <hi>Joh</hi> 16.8, 9. And again,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance</hi> 2. Would we ſhew men the odiouſneſs of all other ſins, how hateful they are to God, and how needful it is that they turn from them to Chriſt, to receive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of them, and waſhing and cleanſing from them? The way is not ſo much to tell them of the Law, and what that ſaith, as to let them know what Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them, and that through his death and ſufferings only, there is forgiveneſs and cleanſing of them, that way will do it, if men in hearing, hear; and in ſeeing, ſee; and perceive what is ſet before them; as we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. Thus the Apoſtle ſaw and judged all to be dead, and in an utterly loſt ſtate in themſelves in this, <hi>that One died for all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 2 Cor. 5.14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance</hi> 3. Would we convince the moſt ſeemingly righteous and juſt man, in his own righteous walking,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:53764:205"/>
and working, that He is a ſinner, loſt in himſelf, and needs to believe on Chriſt, and ſeek Juſtification and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in him; the way is to ſet forth Chriſt, and lift him up as the Son of man, and Saviour of the World, that hath dyed for all men, and through his Death hath the only name, in which there is ſalvation, and that He is the only Juſtifier of men, that will convince them of a need of going out of themſelves, and all their own works and righteouſneſs unto Chriſt to believe on him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15, 16. Thoſe who were not <hi>ſinners of the Gentiles,</hi> but <hi>Jews,</hi> and had great fleſhly priviledges, which they looked upon as advantage to them, yet hereby were convinced of their righteouſneſs, that it would not profit them, even by the Spirit witneſſing to, and glorifying Jeſus in, and by the Miniſtry of his Servants, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 7, 8. as it is ſaid, <hi>He</hi> (the Holy Ghoſt namely) <hi>ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World of righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to my Father, and ye ſee me no more:</hi> Joh. 16.10. And, that's our way through the Spirit, to convince ſuch too: And ſo,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance</hi> 4. Would we convince men of righteouſneſs in Chriſt for them, the righteouſneſs of God freely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for, and given to them of God, that ſo they may come to believe on him? This is the way, glorify Chriſt, and Preach his acceptable Sacrifice, which He hath offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us, that He the Son of God, the Word, by whom all things were made, hath given himſelf the ranſome for all, the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole World, and that He hath offered up ſo acceptable a Sacrifice to God, that in the vertues of it, He is aſcended up to God, and is entertained of him, ſo as He comes down no more to be abaſed, or to ſuffer for us. In the ſight of this, that <hi>men are not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus,</hi> (which implies the vertues of his Death, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53764:206"/>
and the acceptableneſs thereof for taking away ſin, and obtaining favour, for the approachers to God thereby) the Apoſtles and others were moved to let go their truſting in their own righteouſneſs, according to Law, and <hi>to believe in Chriſt, that they might be juſtified;</hi> Gal. 2.16. And ſo in the lifting up of the Son of man, all that have come in to believe on him, have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with thereto; it being as well <hi>through his Name,</hi> that any do <hi>believe on him,</hi> as that they that do believe on him, do, and ſhall <hi>receive there-through remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Act. 10.43. 1 Cor. 1.21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance</hi> 5. Would we convince the World of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that their judgment is naturally falſe and wrong, and that God will judge the World in righteouſneſs, and give to every man according to his works? The way is to lift up the Son of man, and ſhew forth the <hi>truth, as it is in him;</hi> for, that <hi>light makes manifeſt whatſoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,</hi> and lays open the foundation of the Eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſcovers the truth, certainty, and impartiality thereof. Upon this ground, and in ſo lifting up the Son of man, <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> the reproof of their former judgment, and the certainty of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30, 31, 32. And to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi> He ſaith, that their judgment concerning both Chriſt, and all men beſides, ſo as no more <hi>to know them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh,</hi> ſprung from their underſtanding, and judging that <hi>Chriſt dyed for all;</hi> as alſo from thence he grounds the judgment, and the appearance of all before Chriſt's Tribunal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 14, 15, 16. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9, 10, 11, 12. Becauſe Chriſt hath dyed for all and releaſed all from under the firſt judgment, and is there-through become Lord of all, and all ought to live to Him, and not to themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:53764:206"/>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 6 Would we have men to Repent, yea, or exerciſe Faith? The way to move them thereto, is to lift up the Son of man. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſaith, He <hi>testified both to Jews and Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jeſus;</hi> tells us he did that in <hi>teſtifying the Goſpel of the Grace of God,</hi> Acts 20.21, 24. And that he fulfilled his Commiſſion given him of Chriſt, <hi>To open the eyes of the blind, and turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God;</hi> in ſhewing <hi>to them at Damaſcus, and at Jeruſalem, and throughout all the Coaſts of Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and turn to God, and do good Works meet for Repentance:</hi> All which he did in <q>Witneſſing both to ſmall and great, ſaying no other things but thoſe which <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets did ſay, ſhould come to paſs; to wit, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the Dead, and ſhould ſhew light to the People, and to the Gentiles, </q>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 26 18.20.22, 23. Or with theſe Arguments, he moved them to that Repentance and Faith which he Preached and Urged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 7. Would we dehort from any ſin? This is our way to do it, lift up the Son of man, ſhew him to be Lord and Chriſt, that to him we owe ſubjection and obedience; and that he hath <hi>ſuffered for ſins the Juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God,</hi> and therein hath <hi>given himſelf for us, that he might redeem us there-from to himſelf.</hi> So the Apoſtle diſſwades from Fornication, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14.18, 19. and ſo we may diſſwade from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, Fraud, Envy, Malice, and every evil thing, as is implied, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3.9, 10, 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13, 14. and 3.4, 5. Yea, it's the uſual way of the Apoſtles, firſt laying down the Doctrine of Chriſt, and therein lifting him up in the former part of their Epiſtles,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:53764:207"/>
then in the latter part to dehort and diſſwade from all evil, and provoke and ſtir up to all Virtue and Goodneſs. And therefore alſo,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 8. Would we perſwade to Obedience and Virtue? This is the powerful Argument to be uſed, and the way wherein to do it: Lift up the Son of man, and ſhew how all is due from us to God upon account of the Grace in him, and brought to us by him; by which he <hi>Teacheth us, that denying all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent world, looking for the bleſſed hope,</hi> &amp;c. Tit. 2.11, 12, 13. And ſo that's here obſervable that we noted in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going going particular, concerning the manner of the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles, as may be ſeen in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Galatians, Epheſians, Hebrews,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 9. Would we convince of Errour? The way is to hold forth the <hi>Truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> Lifting up and Glorifying the Son of man. So the Apoſtle refutes thoſe that denied the Reſurrection of the Dead, by minding them of the Goſpel Preached to them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of the Death, Burial, and Reſurrection of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. And ſo he reproves the Errours of the falſe Apoſtles and the <hi>Galatians,</hi> by minding them of the Lord Jeſus, his <hi>giving himſelf for our ſins, that he might deliver us from the preſent evil world,</hi> and of the Grace in and of him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and 3.1, 2, 13, 14. &amp;c. and 5.1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 10. Would we comfort any in any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Affliction? The way is to lift up the Son of man, and ſhew the Grace in him, and how God orders all things wiſely and holily in him, ſo as to the good and profit of men, to further their Salvation and Welfare, and that there is help in him in every condition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53764:207"/>
2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4, 5, 6, 13.</p>
               <p>Yea, in a word, would we either humble or exalt caſt down or raiſe up, encourage and ſtrengthen in, and unto what is good, or do any other good thing in which we may profit men; this is the way to do it, <hi>viz.</hi> By Lifting up, and Exalting Chriſt the Son of man, and ſetting him, and the Power, and Grace in him before men; as alſo his Terrours againſt thoſe who refuſe and turn from him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. and 2.1, 3. and 10.26, 29. and 12.25. So that this way we may be profitable to men, doing <hi>all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> as we are exhorted, <hi>giving thanks to God even the Father, by him,</hi> Col. 3.17. But waving this, we do or can do nothing, as is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5, 6. That's the ſecond Motive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive,</hi> 3. Being acceptable to God, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to men, we cannot but be uſeful to our ſelves alſo; both in as much as no acceptable ſervice to God, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable work to men, ſhall be without its reward, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10, 11. And alſo inaſmuch as in Lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Chriſt to others, we may mind him our ſelves if we do it as we ought. And indeed we can ſcarcely Lift him up profitably to others, without viewing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, knowing and taking notice of him our ſelves; and that's the order and way approved of God for our doing it: <hi>Let every one that heareth ſay come,</hi> Rev. 22.17. And, <hi>He that heareth, ſpeaketh conſtantly,</hi> Prov. 21.28. While we view and look upon Chriſt our ſelves, that we may commend him to others, we ſhall not be without Fruit, Profit and Advantage to our ſelves alſo; <hi>opening our mouth wide,</hi> in this ſenſe too, <hi>God will fill it,</hi> Pſal. 81.10. And, <hi>The liberal ſoul ſhall be made fat, and he that watereth, ſhall be watered alſo himſelf,</hi> Prov. 11.25.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:53764:208"/>Wherefore let us make it our buſineſs and deſign to know, and view, and ſerve the Lord Jeſus, and to know and view him, that we may ſerve him; and as we know him, ſerve him in Glorifying and Lifting him up, as we are exhorted Pſal. 99.5, 8. <hi>Exalt</hi> (that is lift up) <hi>the Lord our God, and worſhip him at his holy Hill, for he</hi> (the Lord our God) <hi>is holy.</hi> And let us do this, as in all caſes or to all purpoſes, ſo in all things. As to ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In all the Ordinances of God. In Baptizing, let it be into Him and his Name, ſo as holding him forth, and directing therein, to <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the ſin of the world,</hi> manifeſting Chriſt to men as the Baptiſt did, <hi>John</hi> 1.29, 31. In breaking Bread or eating the Lords Supper; lift up Chriſt the Son of man, <hi>ſhewing forth his Death until he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. Let it not be Baptiſm, and the breaking of Bread, much leſs the Water, the Bread and the Wine that we lift up, bleſs and magnifie therein but the Son of man, they are ſufficiently lifted up in being made the Mediums of lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him up, and conveying Virtue from him to us.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reproof,</hi> 1. Firſt, He is too little lifted up by men, even by thoſe that Miniſter and pretend to be his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to Preach his Goſpel; too many ſuch are faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in not lifting him up in their Miniſtry. Such as</p>

Col. 1.18. Phil. 2.21. <hi>Moſt men proclaim every man his own goodneſs, but a faithful friend</hi> (to Chriſt) <hi>who can find!</hi> Prov. 20.6.</p>

Whether it be the Beaſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Papal, or any worldly Power lifting up it ſelf (like <hi>Jereboam,</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin) in the Temple and Houſe of God, and exerciſing Lordſhip therein over the Conſciences of men and Worſhip of God: As it is ſaid Prophetically of many (yea, of the whole World wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping and wondering after the Beaſt) that they will lift or cry him up, ſaying, <hi>Who is able to make War with him, and to overcome him?</hi> Rev. 13.4.

to, or ſo as withdrawing men from the Son of man, and the ſimplicity in him.

Or that cry up and commend ſome Works and Obſervations of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or much worſe, the Traditions, Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Will-worſhips of men, as is intimated in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 18, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 15 2. Whether only and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as it were; as the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> did the Law and its Works, in oppoſition to Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32, 33. and 10.1, 2, 3. and their Traditions to the <hi>making void Gods Commandments,</hi> Mat. 15.3 4, 9. <hi>Worſhipping God in vain, laying aſide Gods Commandments, to hold mens Traditions,</hi> Mark 7.8. Or in part and Co-part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip with Chriſt and Faith, as they who would divide the honour between them, and make them Partners in ſharing in mens Juſtification and Acceptance with God.

Yea, and here we may obſerve that what the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, of mens having their fear taught them by the Precepts of men, is not only applicable to thoſe that cry up and receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and Impoſitions of the worldly and ſecular Powers, and great Rulers of the people, which ſwarve from Gods Law and Doctrine; as thoſe in the former times of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that when their Kings ſet up their Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholds by Gods Threſholds, and their Poſts by his Poſts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.7, 8. walked in the Statutes of the Heathen, and of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which they made, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.8. <hi>So as the Statutes of Omri were kept, and all the Works of the

houſe of Ahab, and their Counſels, were obſerved more then the Lords,</hi> Mich. 6.16. But our Saviour applied that formentioned ſaying to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharaſees,</hi> who were perſons of the ſtricteſt Sect of Religion among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and a party not only diſtinct, but alſo of a different complexion from the <hi>Herodians;</hi> taxing them for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king void Gods Commandments, by the Tradition of their Elders: For which he calls them Hypocrites, and tells them, <hi>In vain they worſhipped the true God, while they taught for Doctrines, the Commandments of men,</hi> Mat. 15.7, 8, 9. To inſtruct us, that even the Sayings, Gloſſes, and Scriptureleſs Traditions of the moſt zealous and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt Profeſſors of Religion, when they are attended and urged upon men as things to be believed, and their fear of God to be framed by them, rather then Gods Sayings; the Fear and Worſhip of God is thereby cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and rendred vain. Let thoſe then look to it and beware, who denying that Chriſt hath died for all, and is the Propitiation of the ſins of the whole World; do put men upon receiving the Gloſſes of their zealous Elders, and ſo upon Ways and Rules of their impoſing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to know that Chriſt hath died for them, and they may apply themſelves to him as their Saviour; preferring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch like Traditions as thoſe, before the Sayings of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>viZ.</hi> That God hath elected ſome to Eternall Life antecedently to his purpoſe of ſending Chriſt; and for them only he deſigned and ſent him as a Saviour, and for them only he died to ſave them; and that all the reſt he hated and Reprobated from all poſſibility of eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and deſigned to Deſtruction either in the pure created Lump, or in the fallen Maſs, and therefore Chriſt died not for them, nor would God have them ſaved. And then for mens coming to know that Chriſt Died for
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53764:210"/>
them; and ſo that there is a way made for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they put them upon labouring after, and getting ſuch Faith and Frames, as are properly the effects and products of that knowledg, firſt held forth in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to them, and believed or received by them: Putting grievous burthens and heavy to be born, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old were wont to do, in ſtead of directing them to Chriſt, as one who hath certainly come into the World and Died for them, that he might be their Saviour; and they in receiving and believing on him, might be ſaved by him. I ſay, let theſe and ſuch like Perſons, and they that depend upon them, look to that above noted, concerning our Saviours application of that ſaying in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to the ſtrict and zealous <hi>Phariſees;</hi> but this will lead us to another matter of reproof, <hi>viz.</hi> When men,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Lift him not up after the right manner, not as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, as among other particulars in which men may, and do fail in this matter; So in theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. When men lift him not up alone, and ſingly or ſimply; as Alſufficient, and the only able Medicine, ſufficient of it ſelf if looked to, and believed on, to heal and ſave men, and give them Eternal life: But add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to, and with him as neceſſary beſide him, as the falſe Teachers who joyned <hi>Moſes</hi> with him; urging, that <hi>unleſs men were Circumciſed, and kept the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> obſerving days and times, &amp;c. <hi>they could not be ſaved,</hi> Acts 15.2. As ſome ſuch there are at this day, and that of diverſe ſorts, and extreamly oppoſite the one to the other: As the <hi>Papiſts</hi> who lift up prayers to Saints, the Virgin Mary, Pilgrimages, Penances, and many the like humane Inventions and Devices; yea, the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, and obedience to him, and ſome who abhor
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53764:211"/>
them, yet lift up ſuch a form of Baptizing, or of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, or the obſervation of the Seventh-day Sabbath, diſtinctions of Meats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. When they lift him not up high enough ſo as above all, but lift up other things above him, and lay more ſtreſs upon them then upon Chriſt, and the knowledg and mindfulneſs of him, as ſome of them before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. As it's to be feared that ſome do ſo lift up their forms of Baptizing, or the being Baptized again; and others their own Sorrows, Humiliations, Reformations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not as Fruits or Efficacies ſpringing up from Chriſt lifted up, and looked to, but as things through ignorance of Chriſt, put in place of Chriſt; which alſo uſually or often ſprings from what is a fault in too many, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The not lifting him up to all as a remedy prepared for all ſinners, while it's a day of Grace towards them, as one who Died for all, and is riſen again, and is the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſins of the whole World; though it be ſo atteſted of concerning him clearly in the Scriptures, as in 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. And theſe alſo (as all the reſt be) are very Injurious unto men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they rendring doubtful to men, whether there be Virtue in him for them, and ſo whether there be hope for them, by taking away or rendring uncertain the hope of Succeſs, they unhinge them as it were in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Yea, making them believe, that if they be of the number of thoſe he is ſet up for, they muſt needs injoy the benefit of him inevitably; not only if they ſeek, but alſo if they would ſtrive againſt it, yet they cannot fail, becauſe by an irreſiſtable power cauſing them, they muſt be brought to it, they render all eyeing him or ſtriving to behold him needleſs. Or if they withal (contrary to their own principles) tell them there is a need of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, yet while they tell them it's not for all, but
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:53764:211"/>
for ſome diſcriminated perſons only in Gods ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who may know that they are of that number by ſuch marks and frames, ſigns and differences; they put them upon ſeeking for ſuch differencing marks &amp; ſigns firſt, and divert them from eyeing the Croſs of Chriſt (to which they ſhould direct them) and turn them to ſome other things, which are nothing of him. Juſt as if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have perſwaded the people (or rather ſome other oppoſing <hi>Moſes</hi>) that God had not ordained the Serpent of Braſs, for a remedy for all the wounded people; but for ſome ſuch only as might know themſelves to be the perſons, by ſome preparatory operations and partial heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, effected by ſome other means firſt, ſome Herbs, Plaiſters, or the like; and ſo ſhould thereby have diverted their Eyes from the Serpent of Braſs, to other medicines which alſo might be ſo long in getting, or ſo impoſſible to be gotten (as no good ſign of diſcriminative love is to be met with, antecedent to the looking to Chriſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Goſpel) that they might in the interim, have died of their Wounds: So that theſe alſo are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly injurious to men herein, through want of right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and that alſo through not believing, as the Scripture hath ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 7.38.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They alſo exalt or lift him not up rightly, or are too much defective therein, who do it not at all times, in, and unto every Matter and Service of their Miniſtration, for the healing every Sting of the Serpents, every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and Malady of the Soul: Yea, and for preſerving it every where in health too, when reſtored. <hi>David,</hi> a right exalter of him, calling upon others <hi>to magnifie the Lord with</hi> him, and that they would <hi>exalt his Name toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will bleſs the Lord at all times, his praiſe ſhall be continually in my mouth,</hi> Pſal. 34.1, 2, 3. And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>My mouuh ſhall ſhew forth his Righteouſneſs, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53764:212"/>
his Salvation, all the day long,</hi> Pſal. 71.15. As ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that what ever he had to do, or ſay, in the Service of God, and of his Generation, he would do it in the Name and Commendation of the Lord; even of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.12, 25, 26, 27. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. What ever he was to declare to any, either of Sin or Duty, to Reprove, Comfort, Incourage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he would exalt and lift up the Lord therein, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as that whereby his ſayings might be rendred the more effectual. And ſurely, that's the right good and profitable way of ſpeaking unto men; either for reproof of evil, or inſtruction to good; for humbling or lifting up: To fetch the ground of all from Chriſt, and ſhew how every one of Gods Words (or his Word indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>is true</hi> (from him) <hi>as the beginning,</hi> or as having their Foundation in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.160. and their end to lead to him, and glorifie him. And it's obſervable how the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in, and unto every matter, holds forth and lifts up the Lord, even the Lord Jeſus, the Son of man; making him, and the Grace in him, the bottom Ground and Foundation, generally of all Doctrine and Duty, Hope and Expectation, rightly ordered Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Paſſion, Love, Fear, Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo of the whole Converſation. If he reprove of ſin, it is as it is a Deviation from, or Diſhonouring of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1.9, 11, 13, 14, 19. And if he endeavour the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſinner reproved, he doth it in ſhewing the remedy in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if he incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in what is good, he doth it propoſing him, and the Grace and Help in him for us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1, 2, 7. and 12.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If he Preacht Repentance from dead Works, he Preached it in Chriſts Name, as having opened a Door to it, and Adminiſtring Grace for it, and Acceptance in

If faith in the Lord Jeſus: He lifted him up, and exalted Him as the object to be believed on, and affording all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements thereunto, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31, 32. If the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Baptiſmes, or of the laying on of hands, or of the Reſurrection or Judgment to come, He fetched the ground of all from him, as exalted of God to give for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and the Holy Ghoſt; and as become the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the Life, and the righteous Judge of quick and dead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. Now they lift him not up right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then, or are much defective therein, who in treating of theſe things, or any other Doctrines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in preſſing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or reproving any evil ways or practices, ſpeak of thoſe things, as if they were irrelative to him, and He had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, in or about them; as if there were any truth that had no dependance on him, or conducement to his Glory; or any good or duty that wanted motive, ground and encouragement thereunto, in and from him, and the grace and glory in him, or any ſin or evil that was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, or received not aggravation in its evil, by and from the conſideration of its being done, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding him, or the cure and healing of which is not to be ſought for, and found in him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They alſo who lift him not ſimply and nakedly, but ſo garniſhed with the wiſdom of words and eloquence that they lap him up in Lavender, as it were; or in things of an obſcuring ſubſtance, to the hindring of the naked appearance, and the efficacy of his Croſs, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the effects thereof, which the Apoſtle ſuppoſes may be hindred by ſuch kind of Preaching him; it may <hi>make the Croſs of Chriſt of none effect;</hi> 1 Cor. 1.17. and 2.1, 2, 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now if they be reproveable, that lift him not up, as they ought, or not at all, much more then are they ſo,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53764:213"/>
who inſtead of lifting Him up, endeavour to caſt him down, as is ſaid of ſome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.3, 4. They <hi>only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult to caſt him down from his excellency, they delight in lies; they bleſs</hi> (or praiſe) <hi>with the mouth, but they curſe inwardly, or underneath.</hi> And this they do,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either by bringing in <hi>damnable Hereſies, denying the Lord that bought them,</hi> and theſe <hi>bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1.

               <p n="2">2. Or, by their lives and doings, expoſing Him to ſhame, ſcorn, and reproach and ſo denying and decrying him, while by their fruitleſs lives, and ſinful demeanours, and abuſes of the grace of God, they blemiſh the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which they make of him, walking in luſts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, riotous exceſſes, rebellious againſt, and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences towards Magiſtrates and Princes; covetouſneſs, pride, fraud, and the like, who are <hi>the enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> while <hi>in deeds they deny him;</hi> making <hi>their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies their Gods, and minding earthly things, crucifying him to themſelves afreſh, and putting him to open ſhame,</hi> Heb. 6.4, 5, 6, 7. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Jude</hi> 1.2, 7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all theſe, with others are faulty, as guilty of not lifting up Chriſt the Son of man; though of theſe, ſome

make it a piece of Religion to lift up a wooden croſs, and carry it in Proceſſion, and follow after, and look to it, and ſome Image or Picture of him, as crucified, ſet upon, or faſtened to it, or ſo lift up, and look to the Bread or Hoſt, which they call the very Body it ſelf that was crucified, or rather the whole Chriſt; yet of the true Croſs of Chriſt, and the true and right lifting him up as crucified, they are ignorant, yea, and enemies thereto, and ſo are all ſuch as are here mentioned, as reproved.</p>

What ever, or who ever elſe they lift up, yea, though they lift up (as ſome do) humane Virtues; yea, or Gods Gifts and Graces, which are lift up out of their places, when men lift them up neglecting him, the right Spring of all truly good Works; and the Author and Infuſer of all real and right Virtues, as diſcovered to, and looked to by us. So again, many are greatly faulty too, in not looking to, and believing on him when lifted up, as he is rightly lifted up in the Scriptures. And indeed, as the former ſort are reproveable exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as diſhonouring God and Chriſt, abrogating Gods Grace, and obſcuring Chriſts Glory, ſo as men may not clearly ſee it; and ſo are alſo very injurious and deſtructive to men, hindring them of what is prepared of God, for their Welfare and Happineſs; as was noted before: And thereby alſo procure a woe and curſe againſt themſelves; for <hi>how ſhall they eſcape the damnation of Hell,</hi> who ſtand ſo croſs and oppoſite to God in his grand Deſign, and to Chriſt in the Honour due to him and to his Name, and to the good of all men, if they repent not? <hi>Surely wrath is</hi>

               <p n="3">3. So alſo they who look to one another, but not to Jeſus, who think this or that Religious man, or theſe or thoſe good People ſhall help and ſuccour them.

They alſo who truſt in themſelves that they are Chriſts, who truſt in or look to their making mention of Chriſt, their Preaching or Prophecying in his Name, and having ſucceſs therein, ſo as to do many wonderful works, and to have the Spirits ſubject to them; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence to find ſafety and deliverance from their ſins and ſorrows, from wrath and judgment, but look not to the Son of man, ſo as to be healed of their ſins by him. It's not any mans Acts about Chriſtian Profeſſion or Religion, but Chriſt himſelf delivered up of God for our Sins, raiſed again for our Juſtification, and Exalted and Glorified of him, and ſo that Grace in him, that is to be Eyed, Looked, and Depended on by us for all Grace and Bleſſing, yielding up to be Saved and Healed thereby, as in believingly minded it worketh in us; and ſo, <hi>He that looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty and continues therein, being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, ſhall be bleſſed in his doing,</hi> Iam. 1.26.

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Thoſe who having begun to look to him, continue not till in beholding his Glory with open face as in a Glaſs, they be changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord; but look off from him again, <hi>going away from</hi> this glorious <hi>Glaſs</hi> of the Goſpel, in which the beautiful Face of Chriſt, and its Comlineſs, and Glory, for Eſcape and for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

is repreſented; and ſo <hi>forgetting what manner of men they are:</hi> And ſo, what need they have of being healed and changed, yea, and what manner of one he is too, and ſo are not healed and changed as they need. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that,</p>

And truely theſe are in a ſad and dangerous ſtate, puffed up Lucifer-like in themſelves, and may eaſily fall, or rather are already fallen into the fault and condemnation of the Devil; and prove the greateſt miſchief to others, to ſeduce and draw them away from the Simplicity in Chriſt, to behold and dote on them, and to affect a likeneſs to them in like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of Self-ſufficiency in themſelves, and independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on Chriſt-crucified for Life and Salvation: Even as the evil Spirits, or the Serpent fallen into, and by Pride made it his deſign and buſineſs to Tempt and Draw man after him, by the like aſpiring pride to effect equality with God; and ſo into the ſame fault and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with himſelf. All theſe are here by this Doctrine of the Exaltation of Chriſt crucified, the Son of man Lifted up, Reproved, and we may be all warned that we be <hi>not led away</hi> with their <hi>errour, to fall</hi> with them <hi>from our own ſtedfaſtneſs;</hi> even from Chriſt Jeſus, and the Grace in him, and Doctrine of him, wherein our ſtedfaſtneſs lieth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 17.

               <p n="1">1. As to the reaſon and cauſe of it, it appears hence to be, as originally and firſtly their ſin againſt God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking his wrath and anger againſt themſelves, in their perſonal ſinnings againſt his Law and Doctrine, or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:53764:222"/>
will (as the original and firſt cauſe of the dying of the People in the Wilderneſs, to whom alluſion is here made, was their being ſtung and bitten by the Serpents) but againſt thoſe firſt and original cauſes of deſtruction there is a remedy prepared of God in Chriſt, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the Goſpel, and the declarations of God and his goodneſs, leading to repentance, in, and through Chriſt; as there was a Remedy in the brazen Serpent for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there. But as there the ſtung People then periſhed, becauſe they refuſed (if any of them did ſo) to look to that Serpent. So the cauſe and reaſon here of Mens periſhing, is their refuſing to look to Chriſt and to God, in and through Chriſt, and ſo to the grace in him for help and healing, or their refuſing to be healed thereby, through looking off from him to other things: <hi>This is</hi> now the great reaſon of Mens periſhing; <hi>the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Light is come into the World, and men love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light;</hi> refuſing the remedy, becauſe they love their diſeaſes, or love not the ſmart the remedy will put them to, in order to the curing them of their diſeaſes; <hi>becauſe their deeds be evil, for every one that doth evil</hi> (that goeth on, and deſigns to do it) <hi>hateth the light; neither cometh to the light, leaſt his deeds ſhould be reproved,</hi> Joh. 3.19, 20. and ſo we find the Scriptures every where aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that the cauſe of Mens deſtruction is their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rejections of the remedy; as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10, 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When God offered himſelf to <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be their God, bidding them <hi>open their mouth wide,</hi> and he <hi>would fill it,</hi> their refuſing him, his adviſe and counſel, not hearing his voice, nor accepting him to be their helper, but preferring others before him, procured his leaving them to themſelves and their Idols, and then what but miſery and deſtruction could befall them? the like we ſee in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 24, 25. Wiſdom addreſſes her ſelf
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:53764:222"/>
to all within, and without the City or Church of God, reproving their love of their ſimplicity, ſcornfulneſs and folly, and tendring her grace and ſpirit to them, but they generally will not anſwer her calls, and hear her counſels, nor regard the ſtretching forth of her hands to relieve, help or draw them in to her ſelf; but put away all her counſels, and will none of her reproofs, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction comes upon them; the like may be ſeen in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.24, 25, 26. And the like we find our Saviour, and his Apoſtles ſay of the cauſe and reaſon of mens periſhing, not to be any want of goodneſs or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs in God, or want of proviſion in Chriſt, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in him to help them; but mens own wilfulneſs in refuſing, and putting from them the grace and truth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of God, in and by Chriſt to them for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that <hi>they receive not the love of the truth, that they may be ſaved; believe not the truth, but have pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.10, 11, 12. That <hi>they ſtop the ear, cloſe or wink with the eye, leaſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, and be converted, and he ſhould heal them,</hi> Matth. 13.14, 15. Acts 28.20, 27. Yea, the very Heathens, who had the leaſt diſcoveries of God and his goodneſs and grace, that through Chriſt he exerciſeth towards and among men, yet periſh upon this account, that they <hi>with-hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> that, <hi>when they know God they glorified him not as God, nor were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh hearts were darkned:</hi> that, <hi>they liked not to have God in their knowledge,</hi> and the like: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 21, 28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the equitableneſs and juſtneſs hereof; what more juſt and equitable, then that men who will not be ſaved, ſhould periſh? that they who refuſe the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent remedy, and compleat Medicine, and way of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:53764:223"/>
which the moſt wiſe and gracious God in his moſt perfect underſtanding and heighth of love, and affection, hath deviſed and prepared for them, dye of their wounds, which through their own default and wickedneſs, they have brought upon themſelves; Yea, when God hath been at a great coſt and charge to provide man a Saviour, and prepare them help, and ſhewed forth his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therein for their happineſs; when He hath not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his own Son, but delivered him (as made man, the Son of man) for our offences, and raiſed him again for our Juſtification, and therein, and thereby hath ſaved men from periſhing in the firſt Death (into which they were fallen in, and through <hi>Adam</hi>) and therein cured that deadly wound given them at firſt by the Serpent, and hath glorified him, and filled him with his own infinite fulneſs of power, ſpirit, and all ſpiritual grace and bleſſing; therein both impowering him, and appointing him to raiſe all men out of the firſt death (which he alſo will not fail to do) and alſo providing in him all things, by which he is furniſhed for calling and drawing them in to believe, and in believing on him, to preſerve them from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death, and to make them to live for ever; being furniſhed with authority and fitneſs to cure all ſuch ſtings of the old Serpent, as might and would otherwiſe ſting them to that ſecond Death; and all this without their knowledge, motion, or deſire: Yea, and through him alſo, and by him making known to us what he hath done, and calling, and counſelling us to come to him, and accept of his grace and ſalvation, in, and through him (through whom alſo we live, and move, and have our beings, and are made capable of hearing and coming at his call to him, in whom we are ſo compleatly provided for that there is no defect or want of any thing needful for our ſalvation, and everlaſting well-being) yea, and that we
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53764:223"/>
might have both the greateſt ground of aſſurance of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing help in him, and the greateſt ingagements upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to hearken to, and comply with his counſels, and yield our ſelves ſubject to his will and commandements, he hath ſet before men both his alſufficiency, (as being the Son of God, and God; and his having in him all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God) and alſo the greatneſs of the love both of the Father, in not ſparing him, but giving him forth, and preparing him through ſo great ſufferings to be our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and of the Son in ſuſtaining them for our ſakes, that there-through he might be ſo perfected for us; how ſhould he not be provoked to great diſpleaſure, and ſo to leave us to dye and periſh of our wounds, if they, or any of us, after, and notwithſtanding all this, refuſe his calls, and will not ſubmit to him to be ſaved, and be made happy for ever by him? What man of us, and eſpecially what Prince or Nobleman, if he be at great coſt and labour to prepare either a feaſt to entertain, or a Medicine to heal his poor neighbours, likely otherwiſe to periſh through want, or diſeaſes, could take it well, if after that they ſcorn his love, and make light of his proviſion? and yet ſuch is the caſe of Mankind towards God, as the parables in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.1, 14. and <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.17, 24. ſhew. And ſurely the offence is ſo much the greater, and the more inexcuſable and unpardonable in us men, and lays open to the greater, and deſerves the more ſevere puniſhment then any can be deſerved from, or inflicted by the greateſt or mightieſt man, by how much God is greater than man, and more uningaged to us than man; and by how much his proviſion and love therein, and the tenders and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers thereof to men, exceed all that can be found in, or from men. So that <hi>God</hi> will certainly be <hi>juſt</hi> in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt men in his condemning them, and <hi>will be juſtified</hi> in the eyes and ſight of all his Creatures, both
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:53764:224"/>
Angels and men (yea the condemned ones themſelves) <hi>when he is judged;</hi> as is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. And there will be nothing found by men to plead for themſelves, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, when he enters into Judgment with them; not ſo much for that his power and greatneſs will bear them down; as becauſe of the exceeding great equity and righteouſneſs, that will appear clearly and evidently in his proceedings. And if it be ſo equitable, that they who neglect or refuſe to look to Gods ſalvation periſh; how much more will it be ſo for thoſe, who beſide their neglects, and rejections of this remedy themſelves, and through ſo doing, either are unfaithful to God in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of mercy to men; while having ſome knowledge of it, vouchſafed to them, and command to help their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren therein, in ſetting forth, or lifting up this remedy to them, they neglect ſo to do; ſo as through their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs, they occaſion them thorow ignorance and miſpriſions, to erre and periſh there from, (ſurely its but juſt, if thoſe Perſons bloods alſo be required at their hands as is threatned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3 18. and 33.6, 8) or (and much more ſtill, if they alſo) oppoſe and ſet themſelves againſt Chriſt, and the grace of God in him; and the teſtimony of God in the Goſpel concerning him? Inaſmuch as they are not only defective and injurious to their own ſouls, but alſo betray, or offer violence to the ſouls of others, defrauding them of, or driving them from their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing welfare and ſalvation; yea, and (as to the latter ſort) <hi>found fighters alſo againſt God,</hi> and his <hi>Grand Deſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And their deſtruction muſt needs be inevitable and unavoidable, when it befalls them; for, if they only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, and neglect to look to Chriſt, that they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him; yet, how can they poſſibly eſcape deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there being <hi>no other name given under Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:53764:224"/>
they may be ſaved, but this</hi> of Chriſt the Son of man lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs! If there could have been deliverance from Death and wrath any other way, God would not have put his Son upon ſuch abaſement and ſufferings, that we might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him. And now if there be but one Medicine that will Cure a Diſeaſe, and if that be (when with much care and coſt it is procured) rejected, how can that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who rejects it, poſſibly eſcape dying of his Diſeaſe? Such is the caſe here; <hi>Acts</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. And they, in refuſing the grace of God and Chriſt, provoke him to anger; how much more, if they be unfaithful to others, and hinder them of their good? And, how then can they eſcape deſtruction alſo from him, ſeeing He is ſo infinitely great in power, wiſdom and counſel againſt them? A child of three years old may as well or better think to make its party good againſt the greateſt Giant in the World, as the greateſt and moſt powerful Man, or Company of men in the World may think to make his, or their party good againſt God; <hi>Who can ſtand when He is angry, whoſe fury is poured forth like fire, and before whom the Rocks are thrown down;</hi> Noh. 1.6. Thence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet propoſes to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (what is good to be always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by us to our ſelves, when we be tempted to ſin) <hi>Can thine hands be ſtrong, or can thine heart indure in the day when I deal with thee?</hi> Ezek. 22.14. And the Apoſtle propoſes the like to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to perſwade them to look ſingly to God in Chriſt, and not to provoke him to anger, by looking to other things, and committing I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry (which is a ſpiritual adultery with them againſt him. <hi>Do we provoke the Lord to jealouſie?

                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:53764:225"/>But how then can they proſper, and ſtand againſt him, and not be overthrown by him, and periſh from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, who are Enemies and Adverſaries to him, in his Grand Deſign! If its his abſolute Purpoſe and Decree, to the accompliſhment whereof, He ingages all his wiſdom and counſel, power and greatneſs that the Son of man muſt be lifted up, how then can they but periſh, who ſet themſelves againſt him to keep or throw him down, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Perſon, or Truth, or Members? Surely they muſt needs (and its but juſt, right and reaſonable that they) periſh in all their deſigns, purpoſes, and endeavours; there being <hi>no wiſdom, underſtanding, or counſel againſt the Lord,</hi> Prov. 21.30. No fleeing from his Preſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7, 8. Nor ſtanding againſt his Hand or Power: <hi>None ever reſiſted or hardned themſelves againſt him and proſpered,</hi> Job 9.3, 4. All that riſe up againſt Chriſt therefore, whether in Himſelf, his Truth, or People muſt inevitably and unavoidably be deſtroyed; What got <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him, and perſecuting his People, but deſtruction to himſelf, and all his Armies?

It's Gods Decree and Ordination, and it muſt take place: This, Chriſt comforted himſelf with the conſideration of in <hi>John</hi> 6.37. when he had ſaid that the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſaw and believed not on him, He adds as a comfort to himſelf, his Diſciples and Lovers. <hi>All that which the Father giveth me ſhall come to me, and He that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> It is in the neuter Gender, as to the former Branch; not <hi>all they that,</hi> but <hi>all that which the Father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me;</hi> we may underſtand it of all that glory, honour, fulneſs of grace, ſalvation, bleſſing, power, authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this ſhall come to him in deſpight of Men and Devils, that ſet themſelves againſt him, or any who carry unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily towards him, not believing what (or though) they ſee what may commend him to them, and draw them and their hearts after him, as it is ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.13, 14, 15. <hi>Behold</hi> (all ye that love the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> know and behold it for your comfort) <hi>my Servant ſhall deal prudently</hi> (or as the Margin hath it, <hi>ſhall proſper) He ſhall be exalted, and extolled, and be very high: He ſhall be both exalted of God,</hi> with his right hand, and extolled both by the Spirit of God, and by his Servants, the Holy-men; yea, and in due time of all Men, and be very high, exceeding high and glorious; <hi>As many were aſtoniſhed at thee</hi> (ſpeaking to him) <hi>his viſage was ſo marred, &amp;c. ſo he ſhall ſprinkle many Nations.

               <p>Yea, here is a double incouragement: 1. That He ſhall have the heigth and greatneſs that God gives him: He ſhall and muſt be lifted up, and be made high. 2. That He being ſo high, and by conſequent able to help, ſuccour, ſatisfy, and ſave all that come to Him, He alſo is ſo good and merciful, that whoſoever cometh to him for help, ſalvation, or ſatisfaction, he will in no wiſe refuſe or caſt him out, which may both comfort us in his behalf, and incourage us in our own to look to him, who-ever they be that look away from, or neglect and ſlight him: For, <hi>He came not down from Heaven to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him; and this is the will of him that ſent him, that of all that which the Father hath given him, he ſhould looſe nothing,</hi> (nothing of all that honour, glory, Kingdom, &amp;c.) <hi>but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day. And this is the will of him that ſent him, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, ſhould have everlaſting life, and he will raiſe him up at the laſt day,</hi> Joh. 6.37, 38, 39, 40.

Many there be who greatly miſtake that, as well as their Fathers did miſtake the Chriſt, the Son of man, the Lord and Head of it; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cry up and lift up the Church inſtead of Chriſt, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, the Church, the holy Catholick Church, calling men as they think to it, when they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally miſtake themſelves and it; doing as thoſe in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.1, 2. who <hi>Sware by the Name of the Lord, and made mention of the God of Iſrael, but not in Truth nor in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> though they <hi>called themſelves of the holy City</hi> (the holy Catholick Church) <hi>and ſtayed themſelves on the God of Iſrael, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name.</hi> This that men uſually magnifie as the Holy Church, is but the outward Court that is without the Temple, which the Beaſt and Falſe-prophet, the Antichriſt or man of Sin ſits in, and ſets up their Image in; and which the Angel ordered the holy Man to <hi>caſt out</hi> and <hi>not to meaſure,</hi> as being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and no ſufficient mark, by which to know who is Holy and Accepted of God; it being <hi>given unto the Gentiles,</hi> even to thoſe that are Uncircumciſed in heart

and life, boaſting in, and knowing themſelves by, and after their fleſh and fleſhly Priviledges: As their Birth, Breeding, Riches, Learning, Places, Offices, and the like, and walking in, and after the Fleſh, performing and rejoycing in a carnal fleſhly Worſhip, Religion, Zeal, Devotion; and upon ſuch accounts <hi>trampling under foot the holy City,</hi> which they ſay they are of, but Know, Own, or Love it not; but do hate and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, even the true holy Catholick Church indeed, becauſe it hath not, nor approves and applauds, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves and faults ſuch carnal rejoycings and confidences, as Adulteries and Treacheries againſt her Lord, even the Lord Jeſus. That which they cry up in ſtead of it, is the <hi>Whore that ſits upon the many Waters,</hi> or multitudes mounted ſtately upon the Beaſts back, riding him and upheld by him, even by the Imperial power of the World, Dreſſing her ſelf partly with Chriſts Jewels, his Scriptures and Ordinances, mingled with, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by her Adulterous additions, her Inventions, Orders, and Impoſitions in Doctrine and Worſhip; even the Church or Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her Daughters that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe her, or a like power; which is ſo far from being the holy Church, that it is indeed a Neſt and Cage of all unclean and impure Birds; as is too evidently ſeen in the Lives and Practices of thoſe that are of them, too generally from the Pope to the Apparitor, every where. But leaving that filthy Whore with all her Members, drunk with the Blood of the Saints and of the Martyrs of Jeſus, the filthy Sink of ſin and wickedneſs both Mother and Daughters, we may note here: That the true Church is indeed thoſe, and all thoſe who through the Lifting up of the Son of man do believe on him, obeying and following him and his holy Doctrine. All that in their hearts perceiving his Excellency and Goodneſs, do love
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:53764:229"/>
and cleave to him, receive his Commandments, and keep them, being Ruled and Governed by him, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in dependance on him: Theſe as united in, and by one Spirit in and with him, and ſo among themſelves, and one to another in the Faith and Love of him, and love of one another for his ſake, are his holy Church, his Body, all of them together, and Members of him in particular, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.5. And theſe need not to (nor deſire to) Lift up, Preach and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves as the Whore, the falſe Church, and her Members do. But they make it their buſineſs to lift up their Head and Husband, the Son of man, in whom they think themſelves lifted up ſufficiently. This Church knowing her ſelf to be his Body, his Members, his Beloved, ſhe judgeth that ſhe hath enough in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Worth, Height, Glory, Excellency, Power and Authority; and that is the thing that She looks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yea, looks upon and admires, and cannot but talk and boaſt of to others. She deſires nothing but his Love and Fellowſhip, to be admitted into the Knowledg of, and Acquaintance with him, and through him to have Acceſs to, and Acceptance with his Father, who is through him her Father alſo; and that ſhe may Honour and Serve him, and bring forth Children to him. Let him have the Glory, the Power, the Riches, the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Strength, the Honour and Bleſſing; yea, though ſhe be Deſpiſed, Diſhonoured, Impoveriſhed, and made conformable to him in her Uſe and Intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, ſhe is well contented therewith for his ſake. She leans not upon the Power, Riches and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Princes, and of the Nobles of the Earth; though if God perſwades any of their hearts to Favour her, ſhe takes it out of his Hands with thankfulneſs. She relies not upon the multitude of her Members, the great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:53764:229"/>
Learning of her Doctors, the high Degrees, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Eminencies of her Officers and Miniſters in the World, her great Revenues, Poſſeſſions, and Riches among men: Theſe are the things the Whore loves, looks after, and leans upon, and hath her glorying and confidence in. But the true Spouſe of Chriſt leans up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Shoulders, Looks to, Magnifie and Loves, Lives to, and Believes on him for all Peace, inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Protection, Safety, Bleſſing and Satisfaction, ſhe makes it not her buſineſs then to ſerve this World, or the great men thereof to humour, obſerve, comply with and complement them, and receive their Impoſitions in Faith and Worſhip, though according to her Lords di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, ſhe <hi>Submits to every Ordinance of man for his ſake, whether to the King as Supreme, or to the Governours as ſent by him.</hi> And meddles not with Seiſing on their Crowns and Kingdoms, raiſes not up Wars and Commotions againſt them; conteſts not, nor ſtrives with them for worldly Greatneſs, Honour and Riches; thence Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering or Trampling upon them, or ſtirring up Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt them. It's the Whore and her Daughters, and ſuch as drink of her Cup, that practice ſuch things: But ſhe Prays for them, and gives them all due Reverence, Honour and Subjection, as her Lord commands her. It's her great buſineſs to pleaſe her Lord, receive and keep his Sayings, conform her ſelf to his Will and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſeek his Favour, Protection and Countenance; for ſhe depends on him for all things, both for this life, and for that which is to come; and therefore matters not nor fears to diſpleaſe the greateſt Perſons, and expoſe themſelves to their Frowns and Perſecutions for his ſake ſo She and her Members may pleaſe him her Head and Husband, and keep in with him, and keep him with
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:53764:230"/>
them. Such is the Way, Heart, and Carriage of them that believe not on men, nor truſt to themſelves, their own Power, Policy, Riches or Multitude, but believe on the Son of man, as knowing and believing that he though the Son of man, is able and faithful to maintain them, and make them happy.</p>
               <p>And then for Her and their Priviledges, they are ſuch as they have in, and by their believing in him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon him: That is, they are and ſhall be ſaved, and have Eternal life with him in his Kingdom; and theſe Priviledges do very well content her, and every Part and Member of her, as led by his Spirit in her. Though he do not keep them from being Tempted of Satan and his Inſtruments, or from being Hated, Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Oppreſſed, and Perſecuted of men; yea, Fought againſt and Murthered ſometimes by the Beaſt, the Whore or Falſe prophet, and their Members and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, the Limbs of Antichriſt, becauſe he ſees it may be profitable for them, and he knows how to turn it to good to them, and to his own praiſe in their Salvation, and increaſe of Glory; yet ſhe is there-with well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, having the aſſured hope, and certain promiſe and ingagement of her Husband, to preſerve her in his Grace and Favour, and to keep her from periſhing from the way to his Kingdom. She is willing that Satan may be permitted to tempt her as her Head and Husband ſees good, ſo he do but ſtep in between him and her, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her from being defiled or injured by him. She is willing to be Mocked, Scoffed, Buffetted, Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, put to Death in her Members with, and for him, ſo he may be the more Honoured there-through, and ſhe may but Live in, and with him. She is willing to take part with him in the Toſſings, and Troubles
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:53764:230"/>
in the way for his ſake, having confidence that he will preſerve her from fainting and periſhing in the end; and that he will ſee and ſet her ſafe at laſt in reſt with himſelf, in the Injoyments and Embracements of his Love, in his Fathers Kingdom. It is not this Worlds Wealth, Riches, Honours, Ornaments, Scarlet Gowns, Lawn Sleeves, Mitres, Scepters, Crowns, Applauſe, and ſuch like Carnal and Periſhing things; not to have ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Palaces, full and fat Livings and Benifices, the Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Complements of the Rich and Potent in their Meetings, and uppermoſt Seats in Conventions, and the like. In a word, it is not the Eaſe, Safety, Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, Favour of this World, or the Wiſe and Great ones of it that ſhe looks for her priviledges in. No, no, they are the Whore and her Daughters, and Members, that look for ſuch fine things, and contend for ſuch like Priviledges and Reſpects, and by that they may in part be known not to be Chriſts true Spouſe, nor to have their dependance on him, but other things. His true Church are thoſe that believe in him, and look after and rejoyce in his Salvation, that they may be upheld and kept in his Service, that they periſh not there-from, and that they may be ſaved from every evil thing, and obtain Eternal life; the knowledg of the true God the Father, and Himſelf, and the everlaſting Injoyment of their Fellowſhip and Favour, in his everlaſting Kingdom. And theſe are priviledges which the Whore, it may be, ſometime talks of, but in heart ſeeks not, nor rejoyces in: But they are ſuch as far exceed all the priviledges, and greateſt Advantages that can, any other way then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on the Son of man, be injoyed by men; or then are injoyed by any other beſide them. Nor do they that are Members of this holy Church, and this true Spouſe,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:53764:231"/>
envy the enjoyment of thoſe priviledges by any, nor ſtrive to keep them by themſelves or get them, from one another; as the Whore and her Daughters, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do envy their Honours, Places, Ornaments, Fame for Learning, rich Livings, and the like, ſeeking to get or keep them from one another: Nor call others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their Parts, Gifts, Excellencies, as the Whore or whoriſh Members do: But they deſire all ſhould have, and injoy the Favour of the Lord in Union with them, and partake of their Priviledges in joyning with them, in Honouring and Serving him; calling all to him, and not to themſelves, but as in coming to him, they become one in heart, way and deſign of Glorifying him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying ſafety and life Eternal with them. Thence the <hi>Spirit and the Bride ſay come,</hi> they gather to the Lord; and deſire the Lords coming to, and company with them; which the Whore, and her Bawds, and Panders, care not for thinking of, they had rather have his Room then his Company; to have his Place, Honour, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Reſpect, then to have his Spiritual or Glorious preſence with them, becauſe they know themſelves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of diſloyalty towards him, and love their preſent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Injoyments, which they know his coming and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany would part them from. Whereas his true Spouſe believing on him, know his preſence will be the compleat deliverance of them from all danger, and poſſibility of periſhing; and the perfect poſſeſſing them of himſelf, and of that Eternal life that is in him. Such the true Church its Manners and Priviledges.</p>

it, came down and with various Wonders, wrought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance for them, ſo as he brought them all out thence, not one of them being left behind; and then alſo he became their Perfect, Alſufficient, Merciful and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Leader and Bringer in, in their following after him, into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Even ſo God ſeeing us man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, all in great miſery and deſtruction, under the Power and Tyranny of the Devil, and the firſt Death and Judgment which we fell into, in and through <hi>Adam,</hi> came down in the perſon of the Son, and by more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ways of bearing the Judgment and Curſe of the Law for us, taſting Death for every man, and giving himſelf a Ranſome for all men, hath bought all men from under that miſery; the <hi>Free gift being to all men through his Righteouſneſs, to Juſtification of Life,</hi> Rom. 5.18. So as to juſtifie them from that fault and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſo as they live now under the patience of God, and merciful Lordſhip of Chriſt as Lord of all, through his ſaid Death and Sufferings; who alſo offers to all men in the Goſpel, a free Juſtification of them from all their forepaſt ſins, in yielding themſelves up to his Government, ſo as they may live in his Sight. Yea, and now the ſame Chriſt that died for all and every one, and hath ſo Ranſomed us, is become the <hi>Leader</hi> and <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> calling all men to look to, and follow him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. And he will ſave them in ſo doing, and every way ſecure them from periſhing, and bring them into the poſſeſſion of an Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> an everlaſting and glorious Kingdom. For which Guidance and Conduct of us thereto, he is every perfected and moſt gloriouſly Accompliſhed with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Authority, Strength, Wiſdom, Riches for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:53764:232"/>
of all Wants, and is infinitely Merciful and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Compaſſionate, and Faithful, and <hi>will not fail or be diſcouraged,</hi> but will bring every faithful Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of him, or Believer on him to the Injoyment of his Kingdom. Indeed, as there God having ſaved his People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> afterward deſtroyed thoſe that believed not (which alſo for our Admonition, the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> would have us to <hi>remember, though we have once known it</hi>) but that was not through any defect, or want of Power, Pity, or Faithfulneſs in God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, but through their unbelief, not depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him, obeying and Following him, but ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebelling againſt him, and provoking him to anger with their Diſobediences towards, and withdrawings from him. So alſo here, though all men be Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed by Chriſt from periſhing in the firſt Death and Condemnation, that namely which paſſed upon all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> before any man was Born to him; yet there will many periſh in the ſecond Judgment, that which ſhall be by Chriſt after all are Dead and Raiſed again: In the ſecond Death, but that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not neither from want of Power or Pity, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Faithfulneſs in Chriſt, but from the want of their Compliance with his Calls and Counſels to believe on, and Obey him, as the Scripture every where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, as was Noted before in <hi>Uſe</hi> 7. It's moſt ſure that every one that will hearken to his Voice, and Believing on him, Follow him, ſhall have Eternal Life. Yea, and though many Sins and Failings may be found with us, in our Hearing and Following him, as well as many ſticks and Hang-backs before our firſt yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, to be Followers of him (as were alſo found in <hi>Iſrael</hi>) Exod. 5. and 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:53764:233"/>Yet, (as there were many Sacrifices; and a Prieſthood appointed to make atonement for their offences, ſo as they were kept ſtill in Gods favour, and under his conduct, to the Land of Promiſe, not ſtubbornly and perſiſtingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt him; ſo here alſo) we have a far better Prieſt and Sacrifice, greater, fuller, and faithfuller, and of an eternal vertue and continuance, to keep the Followers after Him, from periſhing from Gods favour, and for bringing them to the injoyment of eternal glory: ſo that we may well ſay; <hi>Herein is manifeſted the love of God to us, in that He ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him: Herein is love, not that we loved God, but He loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins;</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9, 10. Yea, we may well cry out with admiration and thankfulneſs; <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the Son of man, that thou haſt ſo viſited him, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 2.6, 7. Yea, ſurely in the mindfulneſs and conſideration of this his ſo rich and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful love and mercy, which led him to this (as the next verſe ſaith, <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him might not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, but have everlaſting life</hi>) we may well give up our ſelves unto him; and ſay, <hi>Truly we are thy Servants, we are thy Servants, the Sons of thy Handmaid,</hi> thy perpetual Servants, <hi>Thou haſt looſed our bonds, offering up our Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable to him, which is our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice of him;</hi> Pſal. 116.16. Rom. 12.1. Yea, how doth it become us to accept this his grace with all acceptation, and for ever to laud and magnify Him; <hi>To enter his Gates with thankſgiving, his Courts with praiſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thankful to him, and bleſſing his Name:</hi> Lauding and praiſing him, that He hath paſſed ſuch a Decree as this; that, <hi>as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:53764:233"/>
muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth on him might not periſh, but have everlaſting life?</hi> And as the Son himſelf, our Lord, the Son of man hath publiſhed, and will publiſh the Decree, ſaying; <hi>I will proclaim the Decree, The Lord hath ſaid unto me, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee; ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmoſt ends of the Earth for thy poſſeſſion; thou ſhalt rule them with an Iron-Rod, &amp;c.</hi> So let us make it our rejoycing, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we mind, to proclaim the ſame to all, calling upon all to hear it, and be glad of it; to imbrace and ſubmit to it, for ever bleſſing him, and calling upon all Creatures to bleſs him with us, who hath ſo Decreed for us, and is ſo Decreed of for us. Let us <hi>lift up our voice and ſing, for the Majeſty of the Lord, and cry aloud from the Sea, glorifying the Lord,</hi> though in the fires of afflictions and ſufferings; even <hi>the Name of the Lord God of Iſrael, (the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the God of all grace, comfort, and conſolation) from the Iſls of the Sea;</hi> Yea, <hi>let us make a joyful noiſe to the Lord, all the earth, ſerving the Lord with gladneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Preſence with a Song.
